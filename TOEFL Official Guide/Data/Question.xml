<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Vocabulary question. The word being tested is &lt;i&gt;immeasurably&lt;/i&gt;. It is highlighted in the passage. &lt;i&gt;Immeasurably&lt;/i&gt; means “in a manner too big to be measured.” So if Jackson enlarged the President’s powers so much that the results cannot be measured, he enlarged them “greatly.”</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 1, the presidency of Andrew Jackson was especially significant for which of the following reasons?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The President granted a portion of his power to the Senate.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The President began to address the Senate on a regular basis.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It was the beginning of the modern presidency in the United States.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It was the first time that the Senate had been known to oppose the President.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 1. The correct answer is choice 3 because the first sentence of the paragraph explicitly states that this was when the development of the modern presidency began. The remainder of the paragraph is devoted to explaining the significant changes in government that this development involved. The result, as stated in sentence 5, was that the nature of the presidency itself was redefined. Choice 1 is contradicted by the paragraph; Jackson did not give presidential power away, but rather he increased it. Choice 2 is not mentioned in the paragraph: it says Jackson addressed the Senate, but not that this was the beginning of regular addresses. Choice 4, which says that this was the first time the Senate opposed the President, is not stated in the passage.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It is asking you why the author mentions “bankers and investors” in the passage. The phrase being tested is highlighted in the passage. The correct answer is choice 2. The author is using bankers and investors as examples of people that the Democrats claimed  “manipulated” the banking system for their own profit. That means that they were unfairly becoming rich. Choices 1, 3, and 4 are all incorrect because, based upon the passage, they seem unlikely to be true. Therefore the author would not use them as examples.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 3, Whigs believed that commerce and economic development would have which of the following effects on society?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>They would promote the advancement of society as a whole.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>They would cause disagreements between Whigs and Democrats.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They would supply new positions for Whig Party members.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They would prevent conflict between farmers and workers.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 3. Choice 1 is the correct answer. The paragraph says that Whigs believed commerce and economic development “would benefit everyone.” That means essentially the same thing as choice 1, which says that Whigs believed economic growth &quot;would promote the advancement of society as a whole.” “Society as a whole” is another way of saying “everyone.” Choices 2 and 3 are not mentioned in the paragraph. Choice 4, about conflict between groups, is mentioned but in a different context, so it is not a belief held by Whigs.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 3, which of the following describes the Whig Party’s view of the role of government?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>To regulate the continuing conflict between farmers and businesspeople</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>To restrict the changes brought about by the market</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>To maintain an economy that allowed all capable citizens to benefit</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To reduce the emphasis on economic development</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 3. The correct answer is choice 3: the Whigs viewed government as responsible for maintaining an economy that allowed all capable citizens to benefit. This is a restatement of paragraph 3, sentence 5. The paragraph states that Whigs did not envision continuing conflict between farmers and businesspeople, so choice 1 is wrong. Whigs favored changes brought about by the market, so choice 2 is wrong. Whigs were in favor of increased emphasis on economic development, so choice 4 is incorrect.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Vocabulary question. The word being tested is &lt;i&gt;inclination&lt;/i&gt;. It is highlighted in the passage. The fact that Jackson had an &lt;i&gt;inclination&lt;/i&gt; to be a strong President means that he preferred being strong to having limited powers. In other words, his “tendency” was to favor a strong presidency, so choice 2 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

The passage says, “for Whigs the concept of government...” In other words, “the way Whigs thought about government …” That process of thinking represents ideas, so choice 4 is the correct answer here.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about variations in political beliefs within the Whig Party?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>They were focused on issues of public liberty.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>They caused some members to leave the Whig party.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They were unimportant to most Whigs.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They reflected regional interests.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by paragraph 5. The correct answer is choice 4: variations in Whigs’ political beliefs reflected regional differences. This is supported by sentence 5 of the paragraph, which says that certain beliefs “In particular” reflected the views of northern Whigs. That suggests that Whigs in other regions of the country had beliefs that varied from this view and implies that such differences were regional. The other three choices are not mentioned in the passage in connection with “variations” in Whig beliefs, so there is no basis for inferring any of them.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 6, the Democrats were supported by all of the following groups EXCEPT</Question>

<Answer_Choice_3>rising entrepreneurs</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>individuals seeking to open the economy to newcomers</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Negative Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 6. Choice 2 is the correct answer. Sentence 5 says that it was Whigs, not Democrats, who had the support of planters involved in international trade. The next sentence, sentence 6, says that in contrast, Democrats had the support of the groups mentioned in choices 1, 3, and 4 (“workers,” “entrepreneurs,” and certain other “individuals”). Therefore all of the groups described in the answer choices, except the planters of choice 2, did support the Democrats.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Whigs were able to attract support only in the wealthiest parts of the economy because Democrats dominated in other areas.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Whig and Democratic areas of influence were naturally split between urban and rural areas, respectively.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The semisubsistence farming areas dominated by Democrats became increasingly isolated by the Whigs’ control of the market economy.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The Democrats’ power was greatest in poorer areas while the Whigs were strongest in those areas where the market was already fully operating.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

&lt;tab&gt;The Whigs were strongest in the towns, cities, and those rural areas 
&lt;tab&gt;that were fully integrated into the market economy, whereas Democrats 
&lt;tab&gt;dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated 
&lt;tab&gt;and languishing economically.

The correct answer is choice 4. Choice 4 contains all of the essential information in the tested sentence, but the order in which it is presented is reversed. The highlighted sentence describes areas of Whig strength first, and then the areas where Democrats were strong.

The correct answer, choice 4, describes Democrat strongholds first, and then Whig areas. No meaning has been changed, and no information has been left out.

Choice 1 is incorrect because it states that Whigs were able to attract support only in the wealthiest areas. The highlighted sentence does not say that; it says their support came from places integrated into the market, which can include areas of all economic levels.

Choice 2 is incorrect because it says that the two parties were split between rural and urban areas. However, the highlighted sentence says that Whigs were strong in rural areas that were integrated into the market economy. In other words, the split between the parties was based on the degree to which an area was integrated into the market, not whether it was urban or rural.

Choice 3 is incorrect because the highlighted sentence makes no mention of how (or if) the Whigs’ control of the market economy affected the areas dominated by the Democrats.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “This new party argued against the policies of Jackson and his party in a number of important areas, beginning with the economy,” is best inserted at number 1.

Number 1 is correct because the phrase “This new party” refers directly and only to the Whigs, who are first mentioned (as a recently formed party) in sentence 1 of this paragraph.

Number 2 is incorrect because the sentence before is not limited to the new Whig party. It discusses both Whigs and Democrats.

Numbers 3 and 4 are both incorrect because the sentences preceding them refer to the Democrats (the old party), not the Whigs.</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;The political system of the United States in the mid-nineteenth century was strongly influenced by the social and economic circumstances of the time.&lt;/b&gt;

<Answer_Choice_1>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;The Democratic and Whig Parties developed in response to the needs of competing economic and political constituencies.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_1>

<Answer_Choice_4>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;In contrast to the Democrats, the Whigs favored government aid for education.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_4>
<Answer_Choice_5>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;A fundamental difference between Whigs and Democrats involved the importance of the market in society.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_5>
<Answer_Choice_6>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;The role of government in the lives of the people was an important political distinction between the two parties.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>A,E,F</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; &lt;number5&gt; &lt;number6&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 1, 5, and 6. Choices 2, 3, and 4 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;The political system of the United States in the mid-nineteenth century was strongly influenced by the social and economic circumstances of the time.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Democratic and Whig Parties developed in response to the needs of competing economic and political constituencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fundamental difference between Whigs and Democrats involved the importance of the market in society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of government in the lives of the people was an important political distinction between the two parties.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “The Democratic and Whig Parties developed in response to the needs of competing economic and political constituencies,” is correct because it is a recurring theme throughout the entire passage. It is a general statement about the development of the Whigs and Democrats. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all provide support for this statement with examples of the nature of the competing constituencies in the United States at that time and the ways in which these two parties responded to them.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “A fundamental difference between Whigs and Democrats involved the importance of the market in society,” is correct because it is a general statement about the differences between the Whigs and Democrats. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 6 all provide support for this statement with examples of the differences in the ways that the two parties viewed the market and society.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “The role of government in the lives of the people was an important political distinction between the two parties,” is correct because it is another general statement about the differences between the Whigs and Democrats. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 all explicitly explore this distinction between Whigs and Democrats.

&lt;b&gt;Incorrect Choices&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “During Andrew Jackson’s two terms as President, he served as leader of both the Democratic and Whig Parties,” is incorrect because it contradicts the passage. Jackson was head of the Democratic Party.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “The Democratic Party primarily represented the interests of the market, banks, and commerce,” is incorrect because it is not true. The Whigs primarily represented these groups, as stated in paragraphs 3 and 6.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “In contrast to the Democrats, the Whigs favored government aid for education,” is incorrect because the passage states only that “Whigs in the North were likely to favor aid to education. It is not clearly stated how other Whigs or Democrats felt on this issue.</Rationale>
<Bottom_Note>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summary&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The political system of the United States in the mid-nineteenth century was strongly influenced by the social and economic circumstances of the time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Bottom_Note>

Since &lt;i&gt;unhappy&lt;/i&gt; is the opposite of &lt;i&gt;happy&lt;/i&gt;, it provides the fullest possible contrast and is equivalent to the contrast between &lt;i&gt;Joy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sadness&lt;/i&gt; at the beginning of the sentence.</Rationale>

The author provides various examples of such expressions, and baring the teeth is mentioned as a universal sign of anger. The other choices are all mentioned in the passage, but not in conjunction with baring the teeth, so they are all incorrect.</Rationale>

The word &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; refers to the photographs that Paul Ekman showed to people from diverse cultures, so the correct answer is choice 3, “photographs.”</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 2, which of the following was true of the Fore people of New Guinea?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>They did not want to be shown photographs.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>They were famous for their storytelling skills.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They knew very little about Western culture.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They did not encourage the expression of emotions.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 3, which states that the Fore people of New Guinea &quot;knew very little about Western culture.&quot; The paragraph explicitly says that the Fore had almost no contact with Western culture. None of the other three choices is mentioned in connection with the Fore, so none of them is correct.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The Fore’s facial expressions indicated their unwillingness to pretend to be story characters.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The Fore were asked to display familiar facial expressions when they told their stories.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The Fore exhibited the same relationship of facial expressions and basic emotions that is seen in Western culture when they acted out stories.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The Fore were familiar with the facial expressions and basic emotions of characters in stories.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these items, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

The Fore also displayed familiar facial expressions when asked how they would respond if they were the characters in stories that called for basic emotional responses.

The correct answer is choice 3. It contains all of the essential ideas in the highlighted sentence without changing the meaning. This choice says that the Fore “exhibited the same relationship of facial expressions and basic emotions that is seen in Western culture when they acted out stories.” The sentence that precedes the highlighted sentence states that in a survey, the Fore agreed with Westerners on how various emotions are portrayed. Then the highlighted sentence says that in a different situation (storytelling) the Fore&apos;s expressions were also familiar; that is, these expressions were the same as those exhibited by Westerners in this situation.

Choices 1 and 2 are incorrect because each one changes the highlighted sentence into a statement that is not true.

Choice 4 is incorrect because it says that the Fore were familiar with the facial expressions of characters in stories. The highlighted sentence says that it was the investigators who were familiar with the Fore&apos;s expressions. This is a change in meaning, so it is incorrect.</Rationale>

<Question>According to the passage, what did Darwin believe would happen to human emotions that were not expressed?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>They would become less intense.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>They would last longer than usual.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They would cause problems later.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They would become more negative.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in the passage. The correct answer is choice 1: emotions that are not expressed become less intense. This is correct based on the direct quotation of Darwin in paragraph 3. In that quotation, Darwin says that emotions that are freely expressed become more intense, while “On the other hand” those that are not freely expressed are softened, meaning that they become less intense. Choices 2, 3, and 4 are all incorrect because there is nothing in the passage that indicates Darwin ever believed these things about expressing emotions. Some or all of them may actually be true, but there is nothing in this passage that supports them.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in the passage. You can see that the phrase &quot;facial-feedback hypothesis” is highlighted where it first appears in the passage in paragraph 3. The correct answer is choice 1: research supporting this hypothesis came from studying experiments of the reactions of people to cartoons. This idea is found in paragraph 4, which uses these experiments as an example of how facial feedback works.

Choice 3, the release of neurotransmitters, is mentioned in paragraph 5, but not in connection with the facial-feedback hypothesis, so it is incorrect.

Choices 2 and 4 are not explicitly mentioned at all in the passage.</Rationale>

<Question>According to the passage, stiffening the upper lip may have which of the following effects?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>It first suppresses stress, then intensifies it.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>It may cause fear and tension in those who see it.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It can damage the lip muscles.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It may either heighten or reduce emotional response.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in the passage. The correct answer is choice 4: stiffening the upper lip &quot;may either heighten or reduce emotional response.&quot; This is stated explicitly in paragraph 6 of the passage as a possible paradox in the relationship between facial expressions and emotions.

Choice 1 is incorrect because paragraph 6 contradicts it.

Choice 2 is incorrect because the passage mentions only the fear and tension of a person trying to keep a stiff upper lip, not any fear or tension that the expression may cause in others.

Choice 3 is incorrect because there is no suggestion anywhere in the passage that stiffening the upper lip may damage lip muscles.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “This universality in the recognition of emotions was demonstrated by using rather simple methods,” is best inserted at number 3.

Number 3 is correct because the inserted sentence begins with the phrase “This universality.” The universality being referred to is the fact, stated in the second sentence, that “people in diverse cultures recognize the emotions manifested by the facial expressions.”

None of the other answer choices follows a sentence that contains a universal statement. Sentence 1 mentions that “Most investigators concur,” which means that some do not. Therefore this is not a universal statement.

Numbers 2 and 4 are incorrect because there is nothing in either sentence to which “This universality” could refer.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_6>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;Facial expressions that occur as a result of an individual’s emotional state may themselves feed back information that influences the person’s emotions.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>B,D,F</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; &lt;number4&gt; &lt;number6&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 2, 4, and 6. Choices 1, 3, and 5 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;Psychological research seems to confirm that people associate particular facial expressions with the same emotions across cultures.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Facial expressions and emotional states interact with each other through a variety of feedback mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person’s facial expression may reflect the person’s emotional state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facial expressions that occur as a result of an individual’s emotional state may themselves feed back information that influences the person’s emotions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 2,&lt;/i&gt; “Facial expressions and emotional states interact with each other through a variety of feedback mechanisms,” is correct because it is a general statement that is developed throughout the passage. Questions about the nature of this interaction and details of research on this issue are discussed in every paragraph, so it is clearly a “main idea.”
&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “A person’s facial expression may reflect the person’s emotional state,” is correct because, like choice 2, it is a major idea that the passage explores in detail. Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6 are devoted to discussing attempts to understand whether and how facial expressions may reflect a person’s emotional state.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “Facial expressions that occur as a result of an individual’s emotional state may themselves feed back information that influences the person’s emotions,” is correct because it is the main tenet of the “facial-feedback hypothesis” that is extensively discussed in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6.
&lt;b&gt;
Incorrect Choices&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “Artificially producing the Duchenne smile can cause a person to have pleasant feelings,” is incorrect because it is a minor, supporting detail mentioned in paragraph 5 as an example of a more general, and important, statement about the links between facial expressions and emotion (see choice 6, above).
&lt;i&gt;Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “People commonly believe that they can control their facial expressions so that their true emotions remain hidden,” is incorrect because while it may be true, the passage does not make this claim.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “Ekman argued that the ability to accurately recognize the emotional content of facial expressions was valuable for human beings,” is incorrect because according to the passage, Ekman did not make this argument; Charles Darwin did. Ekman’s research was directed toward determining the universality of certain facial expressions, not the “value” of people’s ability to recognize those expressions.</Rationale>
<Bottom_Note>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summary&lt;/u&gt;

<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 1. The correct answer is choice 4. Sentence 1 of the paragraph explicitly states that Earth’s landscape changes relatively rapidly compared to Earth’s overall age. Choice 1, on the frequency of landscape changes, is contradicted by the paragraph. Choice 2, that landscape changes occur only at special times, is also contradicted by the paragraph. Choice 3, the frequency of landscape changes, is not mentioned.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>At present, they are much higher than the mountains of the Caledonian range.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They were a uniform height about 400 million years ago.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They are not as high as the Caledonian mountains were 400 million years ago.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 2: the Himalayas are higher than the Caledonian mountains. The paragraph states that younger mountains are generally higher than older mountains. It also states that the Himalayas are much younger than the Caledonians. Since the Himalayas are the younger range and younger mountain ranges are higher than older ranges, we can infer that the younger Himalayas are higher than the older Caledonians.
 
Choices 1 and 4 are incorrect because they explicitly contradict the passage. The height of the Himalayas is an indication of their age, and the Himalayas are about the same height that the Caledonians were 400 million years ago.

Choice 3 is incorrect because there is nothing in the paragraph about “uniform height.”</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>When they are relatively young, hills and mountains successfully resist the destructive forces of nature.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Although they seem permanent, hills and mountains exist for a relatively short period of geological time.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Hills and mountains successfully resist the destructive forces of nature, but only for a short time.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Hills and mountains resist the destructive forces of nature better than other types of landforms.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence, successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature, but in act they rend to be relatively short-lived in geological terms.

The correct answer is choice 2. That choice contains all of the essential information in the highlighted sentence. It omits the information in the second clause of the highlighted sentence (“successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature”) because that information is not essential to the meaning.

Choices 1, 3, and 4 are all incorrect because they change the meaning of the highlighted sentence. Choice 1 adds information on the age of a mountain that is not mentioned in the highlighted sentence.

Choice 3 introduces information about how long mountains resist forces of nature in absolute terms; the highlighted sentence says that the resistance is relatively short in geological terms, which is an entirely different meaning.

Choice 4 compares mountains with other landforms. The highlighted sentence does not make any such comparison.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 6, which of the following is both a cause and result of erosion?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Glacial activity</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Rock debris</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Tree roots</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Sand</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 6. The correct answer is choice 4, “Sand.” Sentences 3 and 4 of that paragraph describe erosion in dry areas. Sand is carried by wind and bombards rock; this bombardment breaks down the rock, and, as a result, more sand is created. Thus sand is both the cause and the result of erosion, so choice 4 is correct. Glacial activity (choice 1) and tree roots (choice 3) are both mentioned only as causes of erosion. Rock debris (choice 2) is mentioned only as a result of erosion.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “Under different climatic conditions, another type of destructive force contributes to erosion,” is best inserted at number 1.

Number 1 is correct because the inserted sentence is a transitional sentence, moving the discussion away from one set of climatic conditions (cold) to another set of climatic conditions (dryness). It is at number 1 that the transition between topics takes place.

Numbers 2, 3, and 4 all precede sentences that provide details of dry climatic conditions. No transition is taking place at any of those places, so the inserted sentence is not needed.</Rationale>

<Rationale>The correct choices for the “Constructive Processes” column are 1, 5, and 6. Choices 3 and 7 are the correct choices for the “Destructive Processes” column. Choices 2 and 4 should not be used in either column.

[[T1_R_Q38_R]]
&lt;b&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1:&lt;/i&gt; “Collision of Earth’s crustal plates” (Constructive Process) belongs in this column because it is mentioned in the passage as one of the constructive processes by which mountains are formed.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 3:&lt;/i&gt; “Wind-driven sand” (Destructive Process) belongs in this column because it is mentioned in the passage as one of the destructive forces that wear away the land.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 5:&lt;/i&gt; “Earthquakes” (Constructive Process) belongs in this column because it is mentioned in the passage as one of the constructive forces by which mountains are formed.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 6:&lt;/i&gt; “Volcanic activity” (Constructive Process) belongs in this column because it is mentioned in the passage as one of the constructive forces by which mountains are formed.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 7:&lt;/i&gt; “Weather processes” (Destructive Process) belongs in this column because it is mentioned in the passage as one of the destructive forces that wear away the land.
&lt;b&gt;Incorrect Choices&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 2:&lt;/i&gt; “Separation of continents” does not belong in the table because it is not mentioned in the passage as either a constructive or destructive process.
&lt;i&gt;Choice 4:&lt;/i&gt; “Formation of grass roots in soil” does not belong in the table because it is not mentioned in the passage as either a constructive or destructive process.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Negative Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 1. The correct answer is choice 4. While the text states clearly that buffalo were not studied, it never states &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they were not studied. The text provides the answer to the question in choice 1 by stating that Thomson’s gazelles eat a large amount of fruit. The text provides the answer to the question in choice 2 by stating that wildebeests prefer to eat leaves. The text provides the answer to the question in choice 3 by indicating that the study took place on the Serengeti Plain in East Africa.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_1>distinguish the functioning of their digestive systems from those of East African mammals</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>emphasize that their relatively large body size leads them to have feeding practices similar to those of East African mammals</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>illustrate differences between ruminants and nonruminants through the use of animals likely to be familiar to most readers</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>emphasize similarities between the diets of cows and horses and the diets of East African mammals</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It is asking you why the author mentions the cow and the horse in paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 3. Cows and horses are animals that are familiar to most people, so they are a useful reference point for the reader to understand the types of animals that are ruminants and nonruminants. Choice 1 is incorrect because the author is actually trying to show that the digestive systems of cows and horses are similar to those of some East African mammals. Choice 2 is incorrect because there is no comparison made between the body size of cows and horses and that of East African mammals. The effect of body size on the feeding habits of East African mammals is discussed in paragraph 3. Choice 4 is incorrect because the diets of cows and horses are not discussed at all in the passage. Therefore a comparison to the diets of East African mammals cannot be emphasized or even made.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 3. The paragraph describes in detail the large amount of low-quality stems that zebras eat. The gazelle, wildebeest, and topi given in choices 1, 2, and 4, respectively, are all ruminants. The paragraph states specifically that ruminants are able to derive a large amount of energy from a given quantity of food, unlike nonruminants such as zebras.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 2, &quot;The differences in stomach structure.&quot; Paragraph 2 is devoted to discussing the differences in feeding preferences that result from the different digestive systems, and therefore different stomach structures, of ruminants and nonruminants. The factors given in choices 1, 3, and 4 are all mentioned in paragraph 2, but they are more indirectly and occasionally related to feeding preferences, whereas the differences in stomach structures are shown in the paragraph to always be the primary factor in feeding preferences.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>They are likely to choose low-quality food to eat in periods when the quantity of rainfall is low.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in the passage. The correct answer is choice 3. Paragraph 2 states that zebras wear down the vegetation in a given habitat, and then ruminants, such as wildebeests, arrive to feed on the remaining, lower, leafier vegetation. Paragraph 1 supports this idea by stating that wildebeests prefer to eat lower leaves. Choice 1 is contradicted in several places: paragraphs 1 and 2 each state that zebras eat stems, and wildebeests eat leaves. Choice 2 is contradicted in paragraph 2, which states that large food particles simply cannot pass through the digestive system of ruminants such as wildebeests. Choice 4 is contradicted in paragraph 2, which states that ruminants such as wildebeests do not have to resort to eating low-quality food because they can derive energy from the same quantity of food for a long time.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “The sequence in which they migrate correlates with their body size,” is best inserted at number 4. 

Number 4 is correct because the phrase “The sequence” refers to the set order in which mammals migrate, which is mentioned in the sentence preceding number 4. Furthermore, the phrase “correlates with their body size” prepares the reader for the discussion of the larger, smaller, and smallest animals mentioned in the sentence following number 4. 

Numbers 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect because none of the preceding or following sentences makes a clear reference to a sequence or to body size.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_6>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;Patterns in the migratory habits of East African herbivores are hard to establish.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>B,D,E</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt;&lt;number4&gt;&lt;number5&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 2, 4, and 5. Choices 1, 3, and 6 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;East African herbivores, though they all live in the same environment, have a range of feeding preferences.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An herbivore’s size and metabolic rate affect the kinds of food and the quantities of food it needs to eat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The different digestive systems of herbivores explain their feeding preferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Migratory habits are influenced by feeding preferences.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “An herbivore’s size and metabolic rate affect the kinds of food and the quantities of food it needs to eat,” is correct because it is a main idea introduced in paragraph 2 and elaborated on in paragraph 3. Sentence 2 in paragraph 2 states that body size is one of two main factors that explain feeding preferences. Paragraph 3 then explains in detail why body size is a main factor.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “The different digestive systems of herbivores explain their feeding preferences,” is correct because it is a major idea that is elaborated on at length in paragraph 2. This paragraph details the different digestive systems of ruminants and nonruminants and then describes the resulting feeding habits of those two types of mammals.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “Migratory habits are influenced by feeding preferences,” is correct because this is a major idea that is introduced in paragraph 2 and elaborated on in paragraph 4. It is a logical follow-up to the discussion in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the reasons for different feeding preferences.

&lt;i&gt;Incorrect Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “The survival of East African mammals depends more than anything else on the quantity of highly nutritious fruits that they are able to find,” is incorrect according to the passage. Paragraph 1 states that only Thomson’s gazelles eat fruit. Other East African mammals discussed in the passage eat only stems and leaves.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “Zebras and wildebeests rarely compete for the same food resources in the same locations,” is incorrect because it is a minor idea in the passage. The feeding habits of zebras and wildebeests are discussed in the passage as specific examples of the larger ideas given in choices 2, 4, and 5.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “Patterns in the migratory habits of East African herbivores are hard to establish,” is contradicted by the passage. Paragraph 4 states that species follow the pattern of local rainfall in their migrations.</Rationale>
<Bottom_Note>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summary&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;b&gt;East African herbivores, though they all live in the same environment, have a range of feeding preferences.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Bottom_Note>

<Question>What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about theatrical dance in the late nineteenth century?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>It influenced many artists outside of the field of dance.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>It was very similar to theatrical dance of the early nineteenth century.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It was more a form of entertainment than a form of serious art.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It was a relatively new art form in the United States.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Inference question asking about an inference that can be supported by paragraph 1. The correct answer is choice 3. The phrase “mere entertainer” in sentence 2 suggests that entertainment is less serious than art. Choice 1 is incorrect because we know only that other artists were attracted to Loie Fuller as an artist; there is no information about what fields these artists were in or if their work was actually influenced by Loie Fuller. Choice 2 is incorrect because there is no information about theatrical dance in the early nineteenth century. Choice 4 is incorrect because there is no indication in the paragraph about the length of time theatrical dance had been practiced.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Negative Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 2. Choice 4 is the correct answer. Sentence 2 in the paragraph states that Loie Fuller rejected technical virtuosity, so it cannot be a characteristic of her type of dance.

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Fuller was more interested in dance’s visual impact than in its narrative or emotional possibilities.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Fuller used visual effects to dramatize the stories and emotions expressed in her work.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Fuller believed that the drama of her dancing sprang from her emotional style of storytelling.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Fuller’s focus on the visual effects of dance resulted from her early theatrical training as an actress.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

&lt;i&gt;Although her early theatrical career had included stints as an actress, she was not primarily interested in storytelling or expressing emotions through dance; the drama of her dancing emanated from her visual effects.&lt;/i&gt;

The correct answer is choice 1. Choice 1 contains all of the essential information in the tested sentence. It omits the information in the first clause (“Although her early theatrical career had included stints as an actress”) because this information is secondary to Loie Fuller’s main interest in dance.

Choices 2, 3, and 4 are all incorrect because they change the meaning of the highlighted sentence. Choices 2 and 3 are incorrect because the highlighted sentence states that Fuller was not interested in storytelling, so to say that she dramatized stories or had a particular style of storytelling is incorrect.

Choice 4 is incorrect because the highlighted sentence indicates the opposite idea: it indicates that Fuller’s early career had little effect on her style of dance.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>Fuller’s dances were in harmony with the artistic values already present in Paris.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 3. The correct answer is choice 4. Sentence 2 in this paragraph states that Fuller’s dances were in accord, or agreed, with the Art Nouveau style that was fashionable in Paris at the time. Choice 1 is incorrect because the paragraph says only that Parisian audiences liked Fuller’s work; artists and artistic movements from the United States, in general, are not mentioned in this paragraph. Choice 2 is incorrect because the paragraph states that poets themselves were interested in Fuller’s work. It does not state that poets tried to make other people interested in her work. Choice 3 is incorrect because the paragraph states in the first sentence that Fuller discovered and introduced her ideas herself; she did not borrow or take them from other artists.</Rationale>

Sentence 4 in the paragraph states that Fuller invented the technique of underlighting, or lighting the dancer from beneath. Choices 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect because they inaccurately describe how certain techniques were used by Fuller. Furthermore, none of these techniques is mentioned in connection with Fuller’s &lt;i&gt;Fire Dance&lt;/i&gt;.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question asking why the author mentions Fuller’s dance titled &lt;i&gt;The Sea&lt;/i&gt;. The correct answer is choice 3. The paragraph begins by stating that aspects of Fuller’s expertise with dance grew along with her technical expertise. &lt;i&gt;The Sea&lt;/i&gt; is mentioned as an example of one way that Fuller’s expertise grew, or one way that she developed as an artist, which, in this case, is in the scope of her themes. Choices 1 and 2 are incorrect because &lt;i&gt;The Sea&lt;/i&gt; is not mentioned in connection with the use of music. Choice 4 is incorrect because &lt;i&gt;The Sea&lt;/i&gt; is not mentioned in connection with science.

<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 6. The correct answer is choice 1. Sentence 1 in this paragraph states that Fuller presented works by another artist, Sada Yocco. Choice 2 is incorrect because the paragraph states that Fuller created an all-female dance company at the time of the Paris Exposition, but we do not know if that company, or any particular company, performed in Fuller’s theater. Choice 3 is incorrect because the paragraph states only that she established a school in 1908; we do not know that the school directly resulted from the Paris Exposition. Furthermore, we do not know from the paragraph that a school exists today that is named after Fuller. Choice 4 is incorrect because the paragraph does not state that Fuller’s theater continued to operate after the Paris Exposition ended.</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;Loie Fuller was an important and innovative dancer.&lt;/b&gt;

<Answer_Choice_1>Fuller believed that audiences in the late nineteenth century had lost interest in most theatrical dance.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Fuller transformed dance in part by creating dance interpretations of works by poets and painters.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Fuller’s work influenced a number of other dancers who were interested in experimental dance.</Answer_Choice_3>

<Answer_Choice_6>By the 1920s, Fuller’s theater at the Paris Exposition had become the world center for innovative dance.</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>C,D,E</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt;&lt;number4&gt;&lt;number5&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 3, 4, and 5. Choices 1, 2, and 6 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;Loie Fuller was an important and innovative dancer.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fuller’s work influenced a number of other dancers who were interested in experimental dance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fuller introduced many technical innovations to the staging of theatrical dance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fuller continued to develop throughout her career, creating more complex works and exploring new artistic media.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Correct Choices 
Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;: “Fuller’s work influenced a number of other dancers who were interested in experimental dance.” This is a main idea, presented in paragraph 6. Fuller’s influence on dancers who later became famous for their own work is discussed.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;: “Fuller introduced many technical innovations to the staging of theatrical dance.” This is a main theme of the passage that is repeated in several paragraphs. Her technical innovations are detailed at length in paragraph 4 but are also mentioned in paragraphs 5 and 6.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;: “Fuller continued to develop throughout her career, creating more complex works and exploring new artistic media.” This main idea is the focus of paragraph 5, which discusses her use of music, the more complex themes that she addressed in her dances, and also the films that she appeared in and directed.

&lt;i&gt;Incorrect Choices
Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “Fuller believed that audiences in the late nineteenth century had lost interest in most theatrical dance,” is incorrect because, while it could be true, the passage never makes this claim. The passage suggests only that Fuller lost interest in theatrical dance.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “Fuller transformed dance in part by creating dance interpretations of works by poets and painters,” is incorrect because the passage does not state that Fuller based her dances on the works of other artists. The passage states several times that Fuller’s work was entirely original: she developed her own work and, in fact, invented many techniques.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “By the 1920s, Fuller’s theater at the Paris Exposition had become the world center for innovative dance,” is incorrect because Fuller’s theater only existed for one year, the year of the Paris Exposition (1900). Furthermore, the passage makes no claim about any particular place being the “center for innovative dance.”</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;Loie Fuller was an important innovative dancer.&lt;/b&gt;</Bottom_Note>

<Question>According to paragraph 2, what causes icebergs to sometimes appear dark or opaque?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>A heavy cloud cover</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The presence of gravel or bits of rock</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The low angle of the Sun above the horizon</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The presence of large cracks in their surface</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Factual Information question testing specific information in paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 2. The information in choice 2 is taken directly from sentence 1 in the paragraph, which states that icebergs “sometimes appear dark or opaque because they carry gravel and bits of rock.” Choice 1 is incorrect because, as sentence 2 states, cloud cover may result in “pink or gold” colors, not dark colors. Choice 3 is incorrect because  “the low angle of the Sun above the horizon” is discussed as a possible cause of pink or gold colors. Choice 4 is incorrect because the issue of large cracks in icebergs is not discussed in paragraph 2.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>One explanation notes that green icebergs stand out among other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions, but this is attributed to an optical illusion.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>One explanation for the color of green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion that occurs when the light from a near-horizon red Sun shines on a blue iceberg.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to a great variety of light conditions, but green icebergs stand out best among other icebergs when illuminated by a near-horizon red Sun.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>One explanation attributes the color of green icebergs to an optical illusion under special light conditions, but green icebergs appear distinct from other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

&lt;i&gt;One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion when blue ice is illuminated by a near-horizon red Sun, but green icebergs stand out among white and blue icebergs under a great variety of light conditions.&lt;/i&gt;

The correct answer is choice 4. This choice contains all of the essential information, which is that (1) one explanation for the color of green icebergs is that the green color is due to an optical illusion related to the position of the Sun, but that (2) there is reason to doubt this theory because green icebergs stand out among white and blue icebergs under a great variety of light conditions.

Choice 1 is incorrect because it confuses the evidence against the theory with the theory itself.

Choice 2 correctly explains the theory but leaves out the essential information of the evidence against the theory.

Choice 3 is incorrect because it misrepresents the theory by saying that the green color occurs in a wide variety of light conditions, whereas the highlighted sentence says that it occurs in a very specific light condition—“a near-horizon red Sun.”</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Factual Information question testing specific information in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 1. Sentence 1 in the paragraph discusses “glacial ice—which is formed from the compaction of snow.” Choice 2 is incorrect because the information given describes sea ice, a different type of ice. Choice 3 is incorrect because the information given describes the first step in the formation of green icebergs.

<Question>According to paragraph 4, ice shelf cores helped scientists explain the formation of green icebergs by showing that</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>the ice at the bottom of green icebergs is bubble-free ice formed from frozen seawater</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>bubble-free ice is found at the top of the ice shelf</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>glacial ice is lighter and floats better than sea ice</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>the clear sea ice at the bottom of the ice shelf is similar to ice from a green iceberg</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Factual Information question testing specific information in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 4. Sentence 2 in the paragraph states that clear sea ice is “very similar&quot; to the ice from green icebergs. Choices 1, 2, and 3 do not answer the question asked. Choice 1 is also incorrect because it mistakenly identifies green icebergs as having frozen seawater at the bottom, whereas sentence 1 in the paragraph says that frozen seawater is found on the bottom of glacial ice. Choice 2 is incorrect because the information given is the opposite of what is stated in the passage, which is that bubble-free ice is formed and found on the bottom of shelf ice. Choice 3 is incorrect because the information given is not discussed in the passage at all.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>To suggest that green ice is more easily eroded by seawater than white ice is</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>To support the idea that the green ice had been the bottom layer before capsizing</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To explain how the air bubbles had been removed from the green ice</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It tests why the author mentions that “The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion.” This sentence is highlighted in the passage. The correct answer is choice 3. The highlighted sentence is evidence that the green ice part of the iceberg was once under water. The fact that this green ice is no longer under water but is now exposed to air is evidence that the green icebergs are formed from pieces of the ice shelf that have broken off and turned upside down. Choice 1 is incorrect because the information given, while factual according to the passage, does not explain why the author includes the information that the green ice portion was textured by seawater. Choice 2 is incorrect because there is no comparison made between the erosion of green ice and white ice in the paragraph. Choice 4 is incorrect because, while sentences 1 and 4 in the paragraph state that green ice has no bubbles, there is no information in the paragraph indicating that green ice initially has bubbles and that they are removed.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>Why green icebergs contain large amounts of dissolved organic pigments</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Negative Factual Information question testing specific information in the passage. The correct answer is choice 2. The last sentence of paragraph 4 states that green icebergs capsize, but it does not state why. The information in choice 1 is presented in the last sentence of paragraph 1. It states that forward movement, melting, and waves and tidal action cause blocks of ice to break off of glaciers. The information in choice 3 is presented in paragraph 7, which says that the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica is “uniquely suited to the production of green icebergs.” The information in choice 4 is presented at the end of paragraph 5. It states that “dissolved organic substances are not excluded from the ice in the freezing process.”</Rationale>

<Question>The passage supports which of the following statements about the Amery Ice Shelf?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The Amery Ice Shelf produces only green icebergs.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The Amery Ice Shelf produces green icebergs because its ice contains high levels of metallic compounds such as copper and iron.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The Amery Ice Shelf produces green icebergs because the seawater is rich in a particular kind of soluble organic material.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>No green icebergs are found far from the Amery Ice Shelf.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by the passage. The correct answer is choice 3. Sentences 5, 6, and 7 in paragraph 5 support this information by indicating that the seawater around these icebergs contains the decomposing material of green-pigmented organisms. This decomposing material dissolves in seawater, which then freezes as part of the iceberg. The information in choice 1 is incorrect because paragraph 7 says that the Amery Ice Shelf is well suited to the production of green icebergs. This does not mean that the Amery Ice Shelf produces &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; green icebergs. The information in choice 2 is incorrect because copper and iron are mentioned in paragraph 3 only as &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; color sources in green icebergs. The last sentence in paragraph 3 states that a source other than copper and iron was found. The information in choice 4 is incorrect because the passage gives no indication of where all green icebergs are located. Paragraph 2 mentions the Weddell Sea in Antarctica, and paragraph 7 states that green icebergs “drift” around the Antarctica. Therefore green icebergs can be found far from the Amery Ice Shelf.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “Scientists have differed as to whether icebergs appear green as a result of light conditions or because of something in the ice itself,” is best inserted at number 2.

Number 2 is correct because the sentence provided introduces two possible explanations for the color of green icebergs. Paragraph 3 is the first place in the passage where explanations are offered for the color of green icebergs. The beginning of paragraph 3 is the only appropriate place to introduce these possible explanations.
 
Number 1 is incorrect because green icebergs are mentioned for the first time in the last sentence in paragraph 2. It does not make sense to insert the given sentence, which introduces explanations for the color of green icebergs, before the first mention of green icebergs.

Number 3 is incorrect because its position is &lt;i&gt;between&lt;/i&gt; the detailed discussions of the two explanations introduced in the given sentence. The given sentence introduces the two explanations; therefore it must come &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the discussions. 

Number 4 is incorrect because its position is &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the detailed discussions of the two explanations introduced in the given sentence. The given sentence introduces the two explanations; therefore it must come &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the discussions.</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;Several suggestions, ranging from light conditions to the presence of metallic compounds, have been offered to explain why some icebergs appear green.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Answer Choices&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>&lt;font size=&apos;13&apos;&gt;Ice cores were used to determine that green icebergs were formed from the compaction of metallic compounds, including copper and iron.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>&lt;font size=&apos;13&apos;&gt;All ice shelves can produce green icebergs, but the Amery Ice Shelf is especially well suited to do so.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>&lt;font size=&apos;13&apos;&gt;Green icebergs form when a two-layered block of ice breaks away from a glacier and capsizes, exposing the bottom sea ice to view.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>&lt;font size=&apos;13&apos;&gt;Ice cores and samples revealed that both ice shelves and green icebergs contain a layer of bubbly glacial ice and a layer of bubble-free sea ice.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_4>
<Answer_Choice_5>&lt;font size=&apos;13&apos;&gt;Green icebergs are white until they come into contact with seawater containing platelets and soluble organic green pigments.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_5>
<Answer_Choice_6>&lt;font size=&apos;13&apos;&gt;In a green iceberg, the sea ice contains large concentrations of organic matter from the seawater.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>C,D,F</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt;&lt;number4&gt;&lt;number6&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 3, 4, and 6. Choices 1, 2, and 5 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;Several suggestions, ranging from light conditions to the presence of metallic compounds, have been offered to explain why some icebergs appear green.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Green icebergs form when a two-layer block of ice breaks away from a glacier and capsizes, exposing the bottom sea ice to view.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ice cores and samples revealed that both ice shelves and green icebergs contain a layer of bubbly glacial ice and a layer of bubble-free sea ice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a green iceberg, the sea ice contains large concentrations of organic matter from the seawater.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Correct Choices 
Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “Green icebergs form when a two-layer block of ice breaks away from a glacier and capsizes, exposing the bottom sea ice to view,” is correct because it summarizes important parts of paragraphs 4 and 5. These explain that green icebergs are capsized pieces of ice that have broken off of an ice shelf.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “Ice cores and samples revealed that both ice shelves and green icebergs contain a layer of bubbly glacial ice and a layer of bubble-free sea ice,” is correct because it summarizes the key information in paragraphs 3 and 4 that explains how scientists were able to determine how green icebergs are formed. The scientists compared ice from green icebergs to ice from ice shelves by drilling ice core samples out of ice shelves.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “In a green iceberg, the sea ice contains large concentrations of organic matter from the seawater,” is correct because it summarizes the key information from paragraph 5 about the source of the green pigments in green icebergs.

&lt;i&gt;Incorrect Choices
Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “Ice cores were used to determine that green icebergs were formed from the compaction of metallic compounds, including copper and iron,” is incorrect because it is factually incorrect according to the passage. The last sentence in paragraph 3 contradicts this idea.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “All ice shelves can produce green icebergs, but the Amery Ice Shelf is especially well suited to do so,” is incorrect because the passage does not state at any point that ice shelves other than the Amery Ice Shelf can produce green icebergs.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “Green icebergs are white until they come into contact with seawater containing platelets and soluble organic green pigments,” is incorrect because the passage never discusses whether green icebergs are originally white, or any particular color.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Unchanging physical laws have limited the size and strength of buildings that can be made with materials discovered long ago. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Building materials have changed in order to increase architectural size and strength, but physical laws of structure have not changed. </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>When people first started to build, the structural methods used to provide strength and size were inadequate because they were not based on physical laws.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Unlike building materials, the methods of support used in architecture have not changed over time because they are based on physical laws. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

&lt;i&gt;In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, architecture employs methods of support that, because they are based on physical laws, have changed little since people first discovered them—even while building materials have changed dramatically&lt;/i&gt;

The correct answer is choice 4. Choice 4 contains all of the essential information in the highlighted sentence. It omits the information from the introductory phrase about the size and strength of a structure because the information is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. 

Choices 1, 2, and 3 are all incorrect because they change the meaning of the highlighted sentence. Choice 1 is incorrect because it inaccurately states that physical laws have limited the size and strength of buildings, whereas the highlighted sentence does not indicate this. 

Choice 2 is incorrect because it wrongly makes a connection between building materials and building strength and size, whereas the highlighted sentence does not make such a connection.

Choice 3 is incorrect because it wrongly states that the structural methods initially used by people were not based on physical laws, whereas the highlighted sentence states that structural methods that are based on physical laws have been in use since their discovery.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true about materials used in the construction of buildings?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Because new building materials are hard to find, construction techniques have changed very little from past generations.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The availability of suitable building materials no longer limits the types of structures that may be built. </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The primary building materials that are available today are wood, stone, and brick. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Architects in earlier times did not have enough building materials to enclose large spaces. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 2. Sentence 3 in the paragraph indicates that in the past, structures were built using the available materials. However, sentence 4 in the paragraph indicates that today new materials can be created as needed depending on the design of the structure. Choice 1 is incorrect because sentence 5 in the paragraph indicates that there have been substantial changes in materials and designs in the recent past. Choice 3 is incorrect because sentence 4 in the paragraph indicates that there are many types of materials available today. Choice 4 is incorrect because sentence 5 in the paragraph indicates that it is possible to enclose space more quickly and easily than in the past. It does not indicate that architects were not able to enclose space.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>They are not very different from the buildings of a few generations ago. </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They weigh less in relation to their size than buildings constructed one hundred years ago. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They take a long time to build as a result of their complex construction methods.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 3. Sentence 5 in the paragraph states that structures are now created with a minimum of material, and sentence 6 indicates that there is a difference in weight between buildings being built now and those that were built one hundred years ago. The combined information from these two sentences suggests that modern buildings weigh less than buildings constructed one hundred years ago. Choice 1 is incorrect because there is no discussion of the amount of space that buildings constructed in the past or those built now occupy. Choice 2 is incorrect because sentence 5 in the paragraph states that substantial changes have been made to modern buildings compared with buildings constructed one hundred years ago. Choice 4 is incorrect because sentence 5 in the paragraph indicates that modern buildings can be built more quickly than those built one hundred years ago.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the following correctly characterizes the relationship between the human body and architecture that is described in paragraph 5?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Complex equipment inside buildings is the one element in modern architecture that resembles a component of the human body.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The components in early buildings were similar to three particular elements of the human body.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Modern buildings have components that are as likely to change as the human body is.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>In general, modern buildings more closely resemble the human body than earlier buildings do. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by paragraph 5. The correct answer is choice 4. The reader is required to connect the information in sentences 1 and 3 in the paragraph. Sentence 1 indicates that modern architecture has several components comparable to the human body, whereas sentence 3 indicates that early architecture had few such components. The information in these two sentences suggests that modern buildings more closely resemble the human body than earlier buildings do. Choice 1 is incorrect because sentence 1 in the paragraph indicates that there are three components of modern architecture (skeleton, skin, equipment) that resemble the human body, not just one. Choice 2 is incorrect because sentence 3 in the paragraph states that early architecture did not have interior equipment, which is one of the three particular elements discussed in the paragraph as being comparable to the human body. Choice 3 is incorrect because there is no discussion or implication of how modern buildings or the human body may change.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It is asking why the author includes the description of how the “doorways and windows” of Machu Picchu were constructed. The phrase being tested is highlighted in the passage. The correct answer is choice 3. The author discusses the stone structures used to support doorways and windows in order to provide an example of how the physical limitations of stone were overcome before the invention of the arch. Choice 1 is incorrect because there is no comparison made in the passage between the buildings of Machu Picchu and igloos and adobe structures. Choice 2 is incorrect because, while the passage does state that stone was used in the buildings of Machu Picchu, it never discusses the kind of stone used. Choice 4 is incorrect because there is no discussion of the time needed to construct buildings from stone.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>The invention of the arch allowed new architectural forms to be developed. </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The arch worked by distributing the structural load of a building toward the center of the arch. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The Romans followed earlier practices in their use of arches. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 6. The correct answer is choice 2. Sentences 5 and 6 in the paragraph indicate that the arch allowed new architectural forms to be created. The remainder of the paragraph elaborates on structures created as a result of the arch. Choice 1 is incorrect because sentence 7 in the paragraph indicates that early Mediterranean cultures were the first to use the arch, not the Romans. Choice 3 is incorrect because sentence 10 in the paragraph indicates that the weight of a structure is distributed to the sides of the arch. Choice 4 is incorrect because sentence 7 indicates that the Romans created new uses for the arch, namely in aboveground structures.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “However, some modern architectural designs, such as those using folded plates of concrete or air-inflated structures, are again unifying skeleton and skin,” is best inserted at number 4.

Number 4 is correct because it is the only place that supports both a contrasting idea and a repeated reference to the unification of skeleton and skin. The inserted sentence represents a contrast to the main idea of the paragraph. The inserted sentence also contains the phrase “again unifying skeleton and skin,” indicating that there must be a previous discussion related to unifying the skeleton and skin of a structure. Number 4 is the only place in this paragraph that follows such a discussion. 

None of the other answer choices follows a discussion of the unifying of a structure’s skeleton and skin, nor do the other answer choices provide a suitable point of contrast for the insert sentence.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>A,C,F</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt;&lt;number3&gt;&lt;number6&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 1, 3, and 6. Choices 2, 4, and 5 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;Architecture uses forms and space to express cultural values.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Architects seek to create buildings that are both visually appealing and well suited for human use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the course of the history of building, innovations in materials and methods of construction have given architects ever greater freedom to express themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The discovery and use of the arch typifies the way in which architecture advances by developing more efficient types of structures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “Architects seek to create buildings that are both visually appealing and well suited for human use,” is correct because it is a broad statement that is developed in the first two paragraphs. The first two paragraphs discuss in detail how architecture can affect and possibly improve people’s lives.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “Over the course of the history of building, innovations in materials and methods of construction have given architects ever greater freedom to express themselves,” is correct because it is a general statement that is developed in paragraphs 3 and 4. These paragraphs discuss in detail how materials and methods have changed and improved over the history of building, continually providing architects the chance to create new designs.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “The discovery and use of the arch typifies the way in which architecture advances by developing more efficient types of structures,” is correct because it captures the main idea of paragraph 6, which provides a lengthy discussion of the ways that the arch has allowed new architectural forms to be created.

&lt;i&gt;Incorrect Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “Both clients and architects are responsible for the mediocre designs of some modern buildings,” is incorrect because it is only a minor, supporting detail, which is mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 2. It supports the larger idea in the paragraph that the quality of an architectural design depends on a variety of factors.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “Modern buildings tend to lack the beauty of ancient stone buildings such as those of Machu Picchu,” is incorrect because there is no discussion in the passage of the level of attractiveness of modern buildings.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “Throughout history buildings have been constructed like human bodies, needing distinct &apos;organ&apos; systems in order to function,” is incorrect because paragraph 5 states that early architecture did not have equipment, such as plumbing and wiring, that is comparable to vital organs in the human body.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 3. The first two sentences of the paragraph indicate that ecosystem stability is complicated because ecologists do not agree on the meaning of the word &lt;i&gt;stability.&lt;/i&gt;  Choice 1 is incorrect because it is not discussed in the paragraph. Furthermore, the idea stated in choice 1 is contradicted in sentence 5 of the paragraph, which states that disturbances such as fires can change an ecosystem. Choice 2 is incorrect because there is no discussion of confusion on the part of ecologists about the concept of resilience. Resilience is simply defined in the paragraph. Choice 4 is incorrect because the main idea of the paragraph is to show that the questions of different ecologists are the cause of complications. Furthermore, sentences 4 and 7 in the paragraph provide clear answers to the questions posed by ecologists.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of climax communities?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>They are more resilient than pioneer communities.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>They can be considered both the most and the least stable communities.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They are stable because they recover quickly after major disturbances.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They are the most resilient communities because they change the least over time.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information provided in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 2. Sentences 4 and 7 in the paragraph indicate different perspectives on climax communities: they can be viewed as the most or least stable communities. Choice 1 is incorrect because, according to the resilience theory of ecosystem stability, it is contradicted by sentence 7, which indicates that climax communities are the least resilient. Choice 3 is also contradicted by sentence 7, which indicates that climax communities take a long time to recover after a major disturbance. Choice 4 is incorrect because it is a misunderstanding of the concept of resilience. According to sentence 5 in the paragraph, a resilient community will revert back to a particular form after a major disturbance.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about redwood forests?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>They become less stable as they mature.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>They support many species when they reach climax.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They are found in temperate zones.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They have reduced diversity during mid-successional stages.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by paragraph 5. The correct answer is choice 3. Sentence 2 introduces the discussion of diversity in successional communities in temperate zones, and sentence 3 presents redwood forests as an example of such a community. Choice 1 is incorrect because we can infer the opposite, according to the paragraph. Sentence 3 indicates that the diversity in a redwood forest decreases as the forest matures, and sentence 5 indicates that increased diversity can lead to instability. Choice 2 is incorrect because sentences 2 and 3 indicate that the number of species declines in a redwood forest at the climax stage. Choice 4 is incorrect because sentences 2 and 3 indicate the opposite, namely that redwood forests have maximum diversity in successional stages.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It is testing why the author provides the information that “A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child’s tricycle.” The sentence being tested is highlighted in the passage. The correct answer is choice 1. Sentence 6 in the paragraph asserts the general principle that a complicated system is more likely to break down than a simple one. Sentence 7, the highlighted sentence, provides an example about bicycles that the average reader can relate to. Choice 2 is incorrect because it emphasizes stability, whereas the highlighted information provides an example of the issues related to the complexity of a particular system. Choice 3 is incorrect because sentence 5 in the paragraph indicates the opposite, specifically that stability does not necessarily increase with diversity. Therefore the highlighted sentence cannot be compared to the incorrect information given in Choice 3. Choice 4 is incorrect because the example provided in the highlighted sentence actually supports the mathematical models mentioned in sentence 5.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Ecologists now think that the stability of an environment is a result of diversity rather than patchiness. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Patchy environments that vary from place to place do not often have high species diversity.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Uniform environments cannot be climax communities because they do not support as many types of organisms as patchy environments.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>A patchy environment is thought to increase stability because it is able to support a wide variety of organisms. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

&lt;i&gt;Many ecologists now think that the relative long-term stability of climax communities comes not from diversity but from the “patchiness” of the environment; an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is uniform.&lt;/i&gt;

The correct answer is choice 4. That choice takes all of the essential information in the two clauses of the highlighted sentence and simplifies it into one concise sentence. It omits information from the second clause that is repetitive and therefore not essential to the meaning. 

Choice 1 is incorrect because its meaning is the opposite of that of the highlighted sentence. Choice 1 states that diversity is the key to stability, whereas the highlighted sentence indicates that stability does not come from diversity but rather comes from patchiness.

Choice 2 incorrectly indicates a causal relationship between patchy environments and diversity. 

Choice 3 is incorrect because there is no indication in the highlighted sentence that uniform environments cannot be climax communities.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>&lt;number3&gt; </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>&lt;number4&gt;</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “In fact, damage to the environment by humans is often much more severe than by natural events and processes,” is best inserted at number 2.

Number 2 is correct because it is the best place in the paragraph to elaborate on the idea, introduced in sentence 1, that humans contribute to damage done to the environment. The phrase “In fact” is used to indicate elaboration. Also, the phrase “natural events and processes” in the given sentence provides a logical connection to the example in sentence 2 about the volcanic explosion of Mount St. Helens.

Number 1 is incorrect because it does not make sense to begin the paragraph with a sentence that elaborates on the idea of human damage to the environment before the idea has been introduced.

Number 3 is incorrect because it does not make sense to follow the specific example about the damage caused by the explosion of Mount St. Helens in sentence 2 with a more general statement about damage done by “natural events and processes.”

Number 4 is incorrect because the sentence preceding this square discusses a community’s resistance to destruction. This number is not a logical place to insert a sentence that specifically elaborates on a different idea.</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;The process of succession and the stability of a climax community can change over time.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Answer Choices&lt;/i&gt;</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The changes that occur in an ecosystem from the pioneer to the climax community can be seen in one human generation. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Ecologists agree that climax communities are the most stable types of ecosystems.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>A high degree of species diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Disagreements over the meaning of the term “stability” make it difficult to identify the most stable ecosystems.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Answer_Choice_5>The level of resilience in a plant community contributes to its long-term stability.</Answer_Choice_5>
<Answer_Choice_6>The resilience of climax communities makes them resistant to destruction caused by humans.</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>C,D,E</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt;&lt;number4&gt;&lt;number5&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 3, 4, and 5. Choices 1, 2, and 6 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;The process of succession and the stability of a climax community can change over time.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A high degree of species diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disagreements over the meaning of the term “stability” make it difficult to identify the most stable ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The level of resilience in a plant community contributes to its longterm stability.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “A high degree of species diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem,” is correct because it is a main idea that is developed throughout most of the passage. The first three paragraphs introduce and develop the idea that diversity may result in a stable ecosystem. But paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 introduce arguments to support the idea that diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem. 

&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “Disagreements over the meaning of the term “stability” make it difficult to identify the most stable ecosystems,” is correct because the key idea that ecosystem stability is difficult to quantify is introduced in paragraph 4 and developed throughout the rest of the passage.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “The level of resilience in a plant community contributes to its long-term stability,” is correct because it mentions one important form of stability that is introduced in paragraph 4 and further developed in paragraph 6 in the discussion of environmental damage caused by humans. 

&lt;i&gt;Incorrect Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “The changes that occur in an ecosystem from the pioneer to the climax community can be seen in one human generation,” is incorrect because paragraph 1 states that a pioneer community alone can change over a period as long as 500 years. Furthermore, a climax community typically changes over a period longer than 500 years.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “Ecologists agree that climax communities are the most stable types of ecosystems,” is incorrect because climax communities are described as unstable at several points in the passage, beginning in paragraph 3. The last sentence of paragraph 4 states that climax communities could be the least stable communities, while sentence 2 in paragraph 5 suggests that successional communities may be more stable than climax communities.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “The resilience of climax communities makes them resistant to destruction caused by humans,” is incorrect because it is a misreading of sentence 1 in paragraph 6. The sentence indicates that ecologists would like to know if resilience could make climax communities resistant to destruction. Climax communities are currently being damaged or destroyed by humans and are not therefore resistant to such destruction.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>The climate of the High Plains is characterized by higher-than-average temperatures.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The large aquifer that lies underneath the High Plains was discovered by the Ogallala Sioux Indians.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Before the early 1900s there was only a small amount of farming and ranching in the High Plains.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 1. The correct answer is choice 4. Sentence 2 in the paragraph indicates that there was “low-intensity” farming and ranching in the High Plains region for a short period after it was settled in the 1880s. Choice 1 is incorrect because there is no information in the paragraph that indicates the High Plains had no inhabitants before the 1880s. The paragraph only indicates that the region had not been permanently settled by a particular group—farmers and ranchers. Choice 2 is incorrect because there is no mention of temperatures in the paragraph. The paragraph states that the region had a semiarid climate, but that alone does not give an indication of the temperature. Choice 3 is incorrect because the paragraph does not state who actually discovered the aquifer. The paragraph only indicates that the aquifer is named after the Ogallala Indians because they once lived in the region.</Rationale>

<Question>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Despite the current impressive size of the Ogallala aquifer, the region’s climate keeps the rates of water addition very small. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Although the aquifer has been adding water at the rate of only half a centimeter a year, it will eventually accumulate enough water to fill Lake Huron.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Because of the region’s present climatic conditions, water is being added each year to the aquifer. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Even when the region experiences unfortunate climatic conditions, the rates of addition of water continue to increase. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Sentence Simplification question. As with all of these questions, a single sentence in the passage is highlighted:

&lt;i&gt;Estimates indicate that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but unfortunately, under the semiarid climatic conditions that presently exist in the region, rates of addition to the aquifer are minimal, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.&lt;/i&gt;

The correct answer is choice 1. The essential information about the size of the aquifer and the rate of addition is expressed in simplified, concise language, but the extra details used to help the reader visualize the information have been removed.

Choice 2 incorrectly indicates that the aquifer does not currently have the large amount of water that could fill Lake Huron, whereas the highlighted sentence states that the aquifer does have this large amount of water.

Choice 3 incorrectly implies that the region’s present climatic conditions positively affect the aquifer by adding water. However, the highlighted sentence states that the region’s dry weather negatively affects the aquifer because it prevents substantial amounts of water from being added.

Choice 4 incorrectly states that the rates of addition of water are increasing; but the highlighted sentence indicates that the rate is steady at half a centimeter a year.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>To contrast cattle-fattening practices in the High Plains with those used in other regions of the United States </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It is testing why the author provides the information that 40 percent of American cattle are fattened in the High Plains. The correct answer is choice 3. Sentence 2 of the paragraph provides the general statement that irrigation agriculture &quot;transformed the economy of the region&quot; and the remainder of the paragraph provides three examples of this transformation. The information about cattle is the last of these examples in the paragraph. Choice 1 incorrectly implies that crop cultivation was less important than other factors in the economy of the region. However, the paragraph only provides examples of factors that contributed to the transformation of the region’s economy; it does not indicate whether one factor was more or less important than another. Choice 2 incorrectly indicates that economic activity was not dependent on irrigation. However, sentence 2 in the paragraph states explicitly that the economic transformation was a result of irrigation agriculture. Choice 4 is incorrect because there is no comparison in the paragraph between cattle-fattening practices in the High Plains and those in other places. The last sentence in the paragraph states only that 40 percent of certain cattle are fattened in this region; there is no discussion of the practices themselves.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 4, all of the following are consequences of the heavy use of the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation EXCEPT:</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The recharge rate of the aquifer is decreasing. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Water tables in the region are becoming increasingly lower. </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Wells now have to be dug to much greater depths than before. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Increasingly powerful pumps are needed to draw water from the aquifer. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Negative Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 1. Sentence 1 in the paragraph indicates that the aquifer has a low recharge rate, but there is no indication that this recharge rate is a result of irrigation. Furthermore, sentence 1 implies that the recharge rate is steady, not decreasing. The information in choice 2 about water tables is provided in sentence 1 in the paragraph. The information in choice 3 about the depth of wells is provided in sentence 2 in the paragraph. The information in choice 4 about water pumps is provided in sentence 3 in the paragraph.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 4, compared with all other states that use Ogallala water for irrigation, Texas</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>has the greatest amount of farmland being irrigated with Ogallala water </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>contains the largest amount of Ogallala water underneath the soil </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>is expected to face the worst water supply crisis as the Ogallala runs dry </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>uses the least amount of Ogallala water for its irrigation needs </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 3. Sentences 4 and 5 in the paragraph indicate that much of the aquifer will dry out and specify “The situation is most critical in Texas.” Choice 1 is incorrect because there is no indication in the paragraph as to which area has the greatest amount of farmland being irrigated. Choice 2 is incorrect because there is no indication in the paragraph as to which area has the largest amount of Ogallala water beneath its soil. Choice 4 incorrectly states that Texas uses the least amount of Ogallala water, whereas sentence 5 states that in Texas “the greatest amount of water is being pumped.”</Rationale>

<Question>Paragraph 5 mentions which of the following as a source of difficulty for some farmers who try to conserve water?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Crops that do not need much water are difficult to grow in the High Plains. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Farmers who grow crops that need a lot of water make higher profits.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Irrigating less frequently often leads to crop failure. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Few farmers are convinced that the aquifer will eventually run dry. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 5. The correct answer is choice 2. Sentence 4 in the paragraph indicates that some farmers are less motivated to conserve water because other farmers make money by using large amounts of water. Choice 1 is incorrect because it attributes some farmers’ difficulties to the difficulty of growing certain crops. However, sentence 2 in the paragraph states only that some farmers have switched to crops that use less water; this is not presented as a difficulty. Choice 3 incorrectly states that irrigating less frequently leads to crop failure, whereas sentence 2 in the paragraph mentions less frequent irrigation only as a method of conserving water. Choice 4 incorrectly implies that there are many farmers who do not believe that the aquifer will run dry. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state what farmers believe or do not believe. Only the reactions of farmers to the depletion of the aquifer are discussed. We can infer from these reactions that many farmers do believe the aquifer will run dry.</Rationale>

<Question>According to paragraph 6, what is the main disadvantage of the proposed plans to transport river water to the High Plains?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The rivers cannot supply sufficient water for the farmers’ needs. </Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Increased irrigation costs would make the products too expensive. </Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The costs of using capillary water for irrigation will increase. </Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Farmers will be forced to switch to genetically engineered crops. </Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 6. The correct answer is choice 2. Sentence 2 in the paragraph states that the cost of agricultural products irrigated with transported river water would become too high and therefore uncompetitive. Choice 1 is incorrect because it states that there is not sufficient river water to meet farmers’ needs, but sentence 1 in the paragraph implies that there are “vast quantities” of river water that could be used for irrigation purposes. Choice 3 is incorrect because the paragraph does not indicate that the cost of using capillary water will increase, but instead, sentence 4 in the paragraph indicates that using capillary water will cause the cost of water to increase. Choice 4 incorrectly states that farmers will be forced to switch to genetically engineered crops; the paragraph indicates that there are multiple possible solutions to the water supply crisis that farmers may choose from.</Rationale>

<Question>Look at the four numbers, &lt;number1&gt; &lt;number2&gt; &lt;number3&gt; &lt;number4&gt;, that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.

&lt;b&gt;But even if uncooperative farmers were to join in the conservation efforts, this would only delay the depletion of the aquifer.&lt;/b&gt;

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Insert Text question. The sentence provided, “But even if uncooperative farmers were to join in the conservation efforts, this would only delay the depletion of the aquifer,” is best inserted at number 3. The preceding sentence refers to farmers who use great amounts of water, or uncooperative farmers, and the following sentence at the beginning of the next paragraph refers to the water supply crisis, or the depletion of the aquifer. Number 3 is the only place that provides logical connections to both the preceding and following sentences.

Number 1 is incorrect because the preceding sentence refers to cooperative farmers who have attempted to conserve water, and the following sentence already provides a contrast to these cooperative farmers with the words “Others, however.” Therefore the sentence provided would be repetitive.

Number 2 is incorrect because the following sentence continues to discuss farmers, whereas the sentence provided leads the reader to expect a further discussion of the depletion of the aquifer.

Number 4 is incorrect because the topic of the preceding and following sentences is potential solutions to the water crisis. There is no connection to be made with the actions of uncooperative farmers.</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;The Ogallala aquifer is a large underground source of water in the High Plains region of the United States.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Answer Choices&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;The use of the Ogallala for irrigation has allowed the High Plains to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;The periodic deepening of wells and the use of more-powerful pumps would help increase the natural recharge rate of the Ogallala.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;Given the aquifer’s low recharge rate, its use for irrigation is causing water tables to drop and will eventually lead to its depletion.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;In Texas, a great deal of attention is being paid to genetic engineering because it is there that the most critical situation exists.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_4>
<Answer_Choice_5>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;Releasing capillary water and introducing drought-resistant crops are less-promising solutions to the water supply crisis than bringing in river water.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_5>
<Answer_Choice_6>&lt;font size=&apos;14&apos;&gt;Several solutions to the upcoming water supply crisis have been proposed, but none of them promises to keep the costs of irrigation low.&lt;/font&gt;</Answer_Choice_6>
<Correct_Answer>A,C,F</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt;&lt;number3&gt;&lt;number6&gt; This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 1, 3, and 6. Choices 2, 4, and 5 are therefore incorrect.

&lt;b&gt;The Ogallala aquifer is a large underground source of water in the High Plains region of the United States.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The use of the Ogallala for irrigation has allowed the High Plains to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given the aquifer’s low recharge rate, its use for irrigation is causing water tables to drop and will eventually lead to its depletion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several solutions to the upcoming water supply crisis have been proposed, but none of them promises to keep the costs of irrigation low.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Correct Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 1&lt;/i&gt;, “The use of the Ogallala for irrigation has allowed the High Plains to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States,” is correct because it is the main idea of paragraph 3. This choice summarizes the background information needed to understand the later discussion of the depletion of the aquifer.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 3&lt;/i&gt;, “Given the aquifer’s low recharge rate, its use for irrigation is causing water tables to drop and will eventually lead to its depletion,” is correct because it is a main idea that is developed throughout paragraphs 3 to 5. The information in this choice concisely captures the cause of the aquifer’s depletion.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 6&lt;/i&gt;, “Several solutions to the upcoming water supply crisis have been proposed, but none of them promises to keep the costs of irrigation low,” is correct because this is the main idea of the final paragraph of the passage. The information in this choice concisely captures the likely results of the aquifer’s depletion. 

&lt;i&gt;Incorrect Choices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Choice 2&lt;/i&gt;, “The periodic deepening of wells and the use of more-powerful pumps would help increase the natural recharge rate of the Ogallala,” is incorrect because it is a misreading of the information given in paragraph 4 about wells and pumps. Paragraph 4 states different information, which is that the low recharge rate of the aquifer has resulted in the need to deepen wells and use more-powerful pumps.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 4&lt;/i&gt;, “In Texas, a great deal of attention is being paid to genetic engineering because it is there that the most critical situation exists,” is incorrect because paragraph 6 states that genetic engineering is being considered as one of several solutions to the water supply crisis, but it is never stated who, exactly, is considering this solution. Furthermore, while it is true according to paragraph 4 that Texas has the most critical situation, there is no mention in the passage of what solutions Texas, in particular, is considering.

&lt;i&gt;Choice 5&lt;/i&gt;, “Releasing capillary water and introducing drought-resistant crops are less-promising solutions to the water supply crisis than bringing in river water,” is incorrect because the passage never indicates that one of these solutions is more or less promising than the others. The passage indicates in the last sentence only that all potential solutions will lead to more expensive irrigation water.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; For Listening conversations that take place during a professor’s office hours, it is very likely that the first question will be a Gist-purpose question. That is the case here. This discussion is about how the woman should write her graduate school application, not about an interview or whether she had been admitted. The professor already has her application and has reviewed it, so the purpose cannot be for her to give him the application. Thus choice 2 is the correct answer: she wants advice about the application.</Rationale>

In this case, the professor stresses the following two items that the woman needs to include in her application letter:

1. How her college career has made her interested in graduate school
2. How she stands out as an individual

Thus the correct answers are choices 1 and 3. She does not have a background in medicine (choice 2), and the professor does not mention her teachers (choice 4).</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Making Inferences question. The last thing the professor mentions to the student is that she should think about the format of her application and the statement of purpose. He says that the format of the application can demonstrate her organizational skills and strongly implies that avoiding any writing errors shows thoroughness. By making these points, he is implying that the readers of the application will be influenced by its appearance, even if the influence is unconscious. He says nothing about the readers’ expertise (choice 1); he implies that sometimes they may not read the application carefully, but he does not imply that this is what usually happens (choice 2); and he says the opposite of choice 4. The correct answer is choice 3.</Rationale>

They are not discussing how antibiotics are produced, but how they are resisted, so choice 2 is eliminated. If all you understood was “jumping” and “hopping,” you might think they were discussing athletics, but that is not how those words are being used, so choice 3 is eliminated. Choice 4 is the correct answer: the man is learning how some bacteria acquire genes that make them resistant to antibiotics.</Rationale>

Her statement about meeting her roommate is part of the context in which the main discussion takes place. The man is trying to learn about bacteria, but she is saying they have only a limited amount of time to spend on the discussion. The function of her statement is to tell the man that she must keep her appointment with her roommate and therefore they must finish soon.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; &lt;number3&gt; This is another Detail question. It asks you to identify two ways that bacteria acquire the resistance gene. Both students mention that the gene can be inherited from a parent cell. They then have a longer discussion about the “jumping gene” and how a “jumping gene” can carry the resistance gene to a new cell. Nothing is mentioned about “white blood cells,” and resistance genes being &quot;carried by antibiotics” is directly contradicted by the discussion.

The students say the resistance genes “weaken the antibiotics” and “stop the antibiotics.” From these clues you should infer that choice 3, the resistance genes &quot;make the treatment of bacterial diseases more difficult,” is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_1>A common method of managing water supplies</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The formation of underground water systems</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Natural processes that renew water supplies</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Maintaining the purity of underground water systems</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; The first question in this set is a Gist-content question, as is usually the case in a lecture set. It is important to remember that you are hearing only part of the lecture. The beginning of this excerpt shows that the professor is talking about different ways to manage natural resources. He chooses underground water as an example of a natural resource, and then goes on to discuss one particular way of managing the underground water supply called “safe-yield.” His focus is on the “safe yield” approach to managing underground water supplies. Thus the correct answer is choice 1. The other choices are aspects of underground water that an environmental scientist might discuss, but they are not the focus of this excerpt.</Rationale>

<Question>What is the professor’s point of view concerning the method of “safe yield”?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>It has helped to preserve the environment.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>It should be researched in states other than Arizona.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It is not an effective resource policy.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It ignores the different ways people use water.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; The lecture makes clear that the professor does not think the “safe yield” approach is appropriate. He communicates this indirectly in several ways, particularly when he says, “we’re managing some major water supplies with this principle of safe yield, under a method that will eventually dry up the natural discharge points of those aquifer systems.” Although the term “safe-yield” indicates that it is safe, the professor is saying that it is, in reality, not safe, because it does not take into account the other ways that water can leave the system besides pumping water out for people’s use. The correct answer is choice 3.</Rationale>

<Question>According to the professor, what are two problems associated with removing water from an underground system?

&lt;i&gt;Choose 2 answers.&lt;/i&gt;</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Pollutants can enter the water more quickly.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The surface area can dry and crack.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The amount of water stored in the system can drop.</Answer_Choice_3>

<Correct_Answer>C,D</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; &lt;number4&gt; This is a Detail question. All four choices are possible results of removing water from an underground system, but the professor discusses only 3 and 4.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. The professor asks these questions:

“Now, why is this an issue? Well, aren’t some of you going to want to live in this state for a while? Want your kids to grow up here, and your kids’ kids?” 

The purpose is to point out to the students that, over time, there will be serious consequences to depleting the underground water supply. He thinks the students should consider the future of the state of Arizona. Therefore the correct answer is choice 4.</Rationale>

<Question>What is a key feature of a sustainable water system?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>It is able to satisfy short-term and long-term needs.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>It is not affected by changing environmental conditions.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It usually originates in lakes, springs, or streams.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It is not used to supply human needs.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Detail question. The professor defines &lt;i&gt;sustainability&lt;/i&gt; as the ability to meet present and future needs. Since his main criticism of “safe-yield” management is that it is not sustainable, knowing the meaning of &lt;i&gt;sustainable&lt;/i&gt; is key to understanding the lecture. “Short-term and long-term needs” are the same as “present and future needs,” so choice 1 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; Because the question uses the word &lt;i&gt;imply&lt;/i&gt;, we expect this to be a Making Inferences question. It is, however, a very easy inference. The professor says, “these two ideas are incompatible: sustainability and safe yield.” If the “safe yield” method is incompatible with sustainability, then water supplies managed by “safe yield” are not sustainable. The correct answer is choice 2.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>To help explain Plato’s view about the nature of the human soul</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Gist-purpose question. Most of the excerpt that you listened to was about Plato’s theory that society is made up of three groups. However, the beginning and the end of the excerpt set the context for this discussion. Plato discusses society because he thinks a society is similar to an individual person. The professor is describing Plato’s ideas, and she does not say whether they are true, so neither choice 1 nor choice 2 can be correct. Again, the professor is not concerned with the real, historical societies, so choice 3 cannot be correct. Only choice 4 is possible.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>It will be discussed in more detail in a later class.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It is not an interesting theory.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It is not a very complicated theory.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This question asks you to listen again to this statement:

“Now, some of you may have studied Plato’s philosophy in some other course, so this might be easy. OK. At the risk of boring you, let me give you just an overview of Plato’s ethical theory.”

You are then asked a Making Inferences question. The professor is anticipating that some students may have already studied &lt;i&gt;The Republic&lt;/i&gt; in another class and be familiar with the basics of Plato’s theory. She says that the review may be “easy” or “boring” to students already familiar with the theory, but she is talking about her review, not the theory itself. So choices 2, 3, and 4 are not implied. Choice 1, that some students might be familiar with the theory, is implied.</Rationale>

Then you are asked why the professor says this:

“Well, how can a society flourish if the workers and soldiers don’t control their desires and emotions?”

You are asked the purpose of a question, so this is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. The quote is an example of a rhetorical question and is really an answer to the previous question, “Why do workers and soldiers have to learn self-control?” The question “how can a society flourish …” is a way of saying, “A society cannot flourish if workers and soldiers do not exercise self-control.” The correct answer is choice 2.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>B,C</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; &lt;number3&gt; This is a Detail question that asks you to identify two points the professor makes about Plato’s view of education. Since the lecture has been about both Plato’s theoretical model of society and a model of human nature, you might anticipate that one point will be about society and one about the individual. According to the professor’s summary, for individuals, the intellect must be strengthened through education. For the model society, the leaders must educate the other two groups. The correct answers are choices 2 and 3.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_1>Emotion is usually controlled by the faculty of desire.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Emotion ought to be controlled by the faculty of intellect.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Emotion is what motivates soldiers.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Correct_Answer>0,1,1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>This question is easy to recognize as a Connecting Content question. Based on information in the lecture, you must indicate whether or not certain statements about human emotion reflect beliefs held by Plato. The chart correctly filled out looks like this:

[[T1_L_Q21_R]]
The professor discusses emotions and desires as being controlled by the intellect, but she says nothing about their being related to one another, so statement 1 is not supported by the lecture. According to the professor, Plato does believe that for people to be happy, the intellect must control emotions, so statement 2 is supported. The professor says about Plato’s soldiers, “Emotion is what characterizes this group.” So statement 3 is also supported by the lecture.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>She wishes she did not have to bubble gas through it.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>She realized the odor of gas could be unpleasant.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>She forgot to tell the students about a step in the experiment.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. You are asked to listen to this part of the lecture again:

&quot;What do you need to do to that water besides put fertilizer in it? Anyone ever actually tried to grow plants in water? You must bubble water through it. Bubble gas through it. I’m sorry, you must bubble gas through it. So, gas, you have to bubble through.&quot;

Then you are asked specifically why the professor says, “I’m sorry, you must bubble gas through it.”

In real speech, people sometimes misspeak; that is, they say a word that is different from the one they intended. This happens more often in informal speech, and this discussion is informal. As you can see from the script, in the previous sentence the professor said, “You must bubble water through it.” &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt; refers to water. So she has said, in effect, “You must bubble water through water,” which does not make sense. The professor immediately corrects herself and repeats the correction twice, so the students know she meant to say “gas.” Her purpose is to correct her previous words, so choice 1 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Understanding Organization question. Although this might seem to be a digression, the professor is using an example to explain why plants that are grown in water must have gas bubbled through the water. When people give houseplants too much water, they are, in effect, “growing the plants in water” unintentionally. The plants die because the roots are deprived of oxygen. The purpose of the discussion of houseplants is to explain why, in the experiment, gas was bubbled though the water. The correct answer is choice 2.</Rationale>

But that’s what all the books have, and no one’s ever corrected it. So let me explain to you about this rye plant.&quot;

Like most replay questions, this is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said item. The lecturer says that “one thousand kilometers of roots” did not make any sense to her. She seems to be expressing doubt. But her next sentence makes clear that the “one thousand kilometers” figure is accurate. She intends to explain why such a surprising, or unbelievable, statement is true. The correct answer is choice 3.</Rationale>

<Question>&lt;i&gt;Listen again to part of the lecture. Then answer the question.&lt;/i&gt;

Why does the professor say this?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>He does not understand why the student is talking about engineers.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>He wants to know how the engineers will communicate with their coworkers.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The student has not provided a complete answer to his question.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>He wants the student to do more research on the topic.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; In this replay question, you listen again to a question from the professor, an answer by a student, and another question by the professor. It is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. In order to understand the professor’s second question, you must recognize that it is a repetition of the previous question. By repeating his question after the student’s answer, the professor is signaling that it has not been satisfactorily answered. He is also signaling that the answer to his question is an important point. The correct answer is choice 3: the student’s answer does not include a point the professor wants to make.</Rationale>

<Question>What is an example of a violation of the “unity of command” principle?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>More than one person supervises the same employee.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>A company decides not to standardize its products.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Several project managers are responsible for designing a new product.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>An employee does not follow a supervisor’s instructions.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Detail question. In this lecture, the professor does not explicitly define “unity of command.” But in the last part of the talk, he gives an example of the absence of unity of command: “this engineer working on a project seems to have two bosses.” Choice 1 is the correct response.</Rationale>

<Question>According to the professor, where might there be a conflict in an organizational structure based on both projects and function?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Between architects and finance experts</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Between the need to specialize and the need to standardize</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Between two engineers who work on the same project</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Between the needs of projects in different cities</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; To answer this question, you need to recognize the difference between the examples the professor uses in the lecture and the principle that the lecture is actually about. The question asks about a “conflict” discussed in the lecture. Choices 1, 3, and 4 are about specific conflicts that might occur in one of the organizations the professor uses as examples. Only choice 2 is about the general principle of a conflict between two equally important goals. Choice 2 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>To schedule an interview with him</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Gist-purpose question. This type of question is typically asked first in listening conversations that take place in a professor’s office. At the beginning of the conversation, the student explains that she does not know anyone off campus to interview for her business class assignment and asks the professor if he could recommend someone. This is why she came to his office, so choice 2 is correct. The student mentions that she has already written her questions; therefore she does not need suggestions on how to write them (choice 1). She does not ask for advice on how she might start a business (choice 3). She does not say anything about scheduling an interview or any further meetings with the professor (choice 4).</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>To show that she enjoys writing for school newspapers</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To indicate that she has experience with conducting interviews</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. Choice 1 is incorrect because the interview is for a class assignment, not for publication in a newspaper. The student suggests that working on her high school newspaper has made part of the assignment—coming up with questions—easy for her, not difficult (choice 2). And while it may be true that she enjoys newspaper work (choice 3), that is not why she mentions her high school paper. She mentions it to show she is an experienced interviewer; thus the correct choice is 4.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>He suggests that she read the business section of the newspaper.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>He gives her more time to complete the assignment.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Detail question. To help the student solve her problem, the professor does not offer a list of business owners (choice 1), nor does he offer to change the due date of the student’s assignment (choice 4). The student mentions people who own a shoe store in her hometown, but she does not ask the professor to allow her to interview them (choice 2) because she realizes that the assignment is to interview owners of a &lt;i&gt;local&lt;/i&gt; business. The professor helps the student by referring her to the business section of the local newspaper, which often prints stories about successful businesspeople in the local area; thus choice 3 is correct.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>What personality traits are typical of business owners</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is another Detail question. It is the student, not the professor, who says that opening a business seems risky (choice 1); the assignment does not involve writing an article (choice 2) or developing a detailed business plan (choice 4). The professor says explicitly that he wants the class to learn about the personalities of business owners and what motivates them. Therefore choice 4 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Question>&lt;i&gt;Listen again to part of the conversation. Then answer the question.&lt;/i&gt;

What does the student imply?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>She is surprised by the professor’s reaction.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The professor has not quite identified her concern.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The professor has guessed correctly what her problem is.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>She does not want to finish the assignment.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Making Inferences question. The conversation begins with the student telling the professor that she has a concern about the assignment, but she does not say at first exactly what her concern is. When the professor asks if she is having trouble coming up with interview questions, he is trying to find out what her specific concern is. When she says that she has written some great questions already, she is telling him indirectly that interview questions are not the problem. He has not quite identified her concern, so choice 2 is the correct answer, and choice 3, which states the opposite, is incorrect. Nothing in the student’s words or tone of voice suggests that she does not want to finish the assignment (choice 4) or that she is surprised by what the professor has said to her (choice 1).</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Gist-content question. Choice 3 is correct because the professor spends almost the entire lecture discussing four types of calendars used historically in England, Central America, China, and ancient Rome, as well as the modern calendar used throughout the world today. Errors in early calendars (choice 1) are not discussed; in fact, the professor emphasizes how surprisingly accurate and sophisticated these early calendars were. Choice 4 is incorrect because astrology—the belief that the position of stars and planets can predict events—is mentioned only in the context of the Chinese calendar. Why people came to believe that Earth moves around the Sun (choice 2) is not discussed at all.</Rationale>

<Question>The professor discusses various theories on how Stonehenge was used. What can be inferred about the professor’s opinion?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>She is sure Stonehenge was used as a calendar.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>She believes the main use for Stonehenge was probably as a temple or a tomb.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>She thinks that the stones were mainly used as a record of historical events.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>She admits that the purpose for which Stonehenge was constructed may never be known.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Understanding the Speaker’s Attitude question. The professor indirectly expresses her certainty that Stonehenge served as a calendar by stating, “a lot of &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; think it was designed, at least partially, as a calendar.” Her use of the pronoun &lt;u&gt;us&lt;/u&gt; indicates that she includes herself in that group. When mentioning colleagues who think Stonehenge served another purpose, she adds that &quot;they can’t deny that it was also used as a calendar.” Thus the correct answer is choice 1.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>To predict the outcome of royal decisions</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To allow priests to compare the orbits of Earth and Venus</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Detail question. Choice 1 is correct because the professor states that the Mayans were interested in tracking long cycles of history. There is no mention of lunar months in the discussion of the Mayan calendar (choice 2). It was the ancient Chinese, not the Mayans, who wanted a calendar system to predict events (choice 3). The Mayan calendar was &lt;i&gt;based on&lt;/i&gt; the appearance of Venus in the morning sky and on the movements of other natural timekeepers like Earth, but comparing the orbits of Earth and Venus (choice 4) was not the calendar’s &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt;.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is another Detail question. Choice 4 is correct because the professor states that the ancient Chinese calendar was based on Jupiter’s twelve-year-long orbit around the Sun, not on night-day cycles (choice 1), the Moon (choice 2), or the seasons (choice 3). </Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>By adopting elements of the Chinese calendar</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is also a Detail question. Choice 2 is correct because the professor says that the ancient Romans put an extra day into the calendar every four years to account for the actual length of a single Earth orbit, which is 365¼ days. According to the professor, this addition, which improved the calendar’s precision, is what made the calendar work so well that it is still widely used.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>By emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of using various time cycles</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Understanding Organization question. Before discussing any specific calendars, the professor identifies a problem: that all calendars are based on natural astronomical cycles, which are not coordinated with one another mathematically. The professor then describes various historical calendars and the natural cycles on which they were based, ending with a description of the modern calendar and its solution to the coordination problem. Thus choice 1 is correct.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>Various ways dolphins communicate with one another</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt;  This is a Gist-content question. Choice 4 is correct because everything the professor discusses relates to dolphin communication. In some lectures, the main topic does not become clear until the professor has been talking for a few seconds or a minute. However, in this case, the professor announces the topic almost immediately: after reminding the class that they have &quot;been previously discussing animal communication,&quot; she says, “today we’re going to talk about dolphins.”</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Detail question. Choice 3 is correct. The professor explicitly refers to a theory that says one of the reasons dolphins swim side by side is to avoid interference from each other’s sonar clicks. Dolphins do not need to swim side by side to see their bubble streams (choice 1) or to hear their signature whistles (choice 2). Choice 4 is incorrect because the professor says that mother dolphins use signature whistles, not swimming side by side, to locate their young.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>They do not appear to serve a communicative function.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Dolphins use them to sense the movement of the water.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Making Inferences question that requires the integration of information from two parts of the lecture. Early in the lecture, the professor says that each dolphin has a unique signature whistle and that dolphins use these whistles to call to and identify one another. Later, she makes a similar statement about bubble streams: dolphins use bubble streams to identify and greet each other. The professor does not actually use the word &lt;u&gt;function&lt;/u&gt; in describing signature whistles or bubble streams, and she does not make any &lt;i&gt;explicit &lt;/i&gt;statements to compare their functions. Instead, by giving a similar description of them in different parts of the lecture, she &lt;i&gt;implies&lt;/i&gt; that their functions are similar, making choice 2 the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Understanding the Speaker’s Attitude question. At the end of the lecture, the professor speaks enthusiastically about the time she spent on a boat doing research. She says that fieldwork is a “wonderful” way to &quot;experience something you’ve been studying in a classroom.” By giving such a positive description of her personal experience on a research boat, she is encouraging her students to do fieldwork too, if they ever have the opportunity. Therefore choice 1 is correct.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>One way dolphins use signature whistles</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Understanding Organization question. Choice 4 is correct because the professor uses the example of calling another person’s name in a forest as an analogy, to illustrate how dolphins call to and identify each other using signature whistles. In an analogy like this, the similarity between people and dolphins is what is important, not their differences, so choice 1 is incorrect. Burst pulses (choice 2) are used by dolphins for displaying aggression, showing dominance, and attracting a mate; although those functions are all related to communication, they are not illustrated by the example. Choice 3 is incorrect because there is nothing about the size of groups mentioned in the lecture.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Gist-purpose question. The student wants Professor Kirk to give him permission to enroll in a course that is already full. In order to do this, the professor must sign a form that the student has brought with him. That is why he is there; thus choice 4 is correct. The student already knows that he must take a science course in order to graduate (choice 1). There is no indication that Professor Kirk has invited the student to her office (choice 2), and the student already has an advisor (choice 3).</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Detail question. When the man says he will graduate soon, the woman says “oh, wow” and points out that most students fulfill their science requirement their first year. This indicates that she is surprised that the man has waited so long, making choice 2 the correct answer. None of the other choices is factually true, according to the information in the conversation.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is another Detail question. Choice 1 is correct because it paraphrases the man’s statement that his advisor has &quot;been after me to take a class like this for a while.” She wants him to take the class because she is aware of the man’s situation and knows he cannot graduate without the science class. Therefore choice 3, which states that she is unaware of his problem, is incorrect. There is nothing in the conversation indicating that the advisor encouraged the man to major in journalism (choice 2). And although Professor Kirk’s popularity among students is mentioned in the conversation, no reference is made to the advisor’s opinion of Professor Kirk (choice 4).</Rationale>

Choice 2 captures both the man’s politeness and his intention. The man’s problem is not yet solved (choice 1), and he has already explained what he needs (choice 3). Choice 4 is incorrect because the woman implied earlier that it is Professor Kirk, not she, who is busy.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Gist-content question. The professor begins by saying that an abundance of data is reshaping &quot;our vision of the planet in a lot of ways.” He goes on to discuss how Mars was imagined before it was visited by spacecraft, and then how, in recent years, successive spacecraft have sent back detailed images that are providing an increasingly realistic view of the planet.

<Answer_Choice_3>It had at one time supported life.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It had water under its surface.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Detail question. Choice 1 is correct because the professor says that the images obtained in 1965 made Mars appear as dry and dead as the Moon, with “lots of craters and not much else.” He mentions the 1965 view that Mars was very cold, but he does not say that the images showed it to be similar to Earth (choice 2)—quite the opposite. The existence of life on Mars in the distant past is presented not as a conclusion (choice 3) but as a matter of theory and speculation coming after the 1970s orbits and the even more recent Mars landings. The theory that water exists under Mars’s surface (choice 4) is also a recent development.</Rationale>

<Question>What does the professor imply about conditions on Mars billions of years ago?

&lt;i&gt;Choose 2 answers.&lt;/i&gt;</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Mars was probably even drier than it is today.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The atmospheric pressure and the temperature may have been higher than they are today.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Mars was inhabited by organisms that have since become fossilized.</Answer_Choice_3>

<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt;&lt;number4&gt; This is a Making Inferences question. Note that the square boxes in front of the answer choices indicate that you must select two correct answers. In the lecture, the professor contrasts the dry conditions of Mars today with the possibility that Mars had water on its surface billions of years ago. Choice 2, which says that the atmospheric pressure and the temperature may have been higher on Mars in the past than they are today, forms part of his explanation of how Mars could once have had water. Choice 4 is also correct because part of the evidence for the existence of water on Mars is the plains and the dried-up riverbeds currently visible on Mars’s surface; according to the professor, they could have been created by flooding.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>They may indicate the current existence of water on Mars.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They may hold fossils of organisms that once existed on Mars.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Detail question. One of the students mentions that she has seen news reports that showed gullies on Mars, and she says that they seem to be evidence of water. The professor confirms that gullies may indeed be evidence of water on Mars and says that there are theories that water under the surface caused the gullies to form. Thus choice 3 is correct. The professor mentions volcanoes on Mars (choice 1) and Mars’s dry climate (choice 2), but he does not associate either with gullies. References are made to fossils but not to any actual fossils (choice 4); the professor uses the word &lt;u&gt;fossil&lt;/u&gt; metaphorically when he likens the entire planet to an object that may be dead but that is nevertheless worth investigating because it was once alive.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is an Understanding Organization question. In this replayed statement, the professor uses imagery to describe the early conception of Mars—“a dead, boring rock”—and the modern conception formed by additional evidence—“a fascinating fossil that was once alive and dynamic.” By making this contrast, the professor both sums up the lecture and emphasizes that the change in our view of Mars was a very significant one. Thus the correct answer is choice 4.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. The student’s comment is an indirect criticism of early filmmakers for their unrealistic portrayals of Mars. Thus choice 2 is correct. His opinion is a negative one, so he is not expressing approval (choice 4). The student is not seeking clarification or rephrasing a previous question, so choices 1 and 3 do not accurately reflect the intention of his statement.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Gist-content question. The lecture is part of a larger arthistory lecture on the general topic of colossal statues. Having completed his discussion of ancient colossal statues, the professor now focuses on modern times and begins by raising this question: why would elected officials be willing to invest enormous sums of public money to create colossal statues? To understand why, he says, one needs to “reexamine more closely their role as social and political symbols.” Choice 3 best expresses that idea. Choices 1, 2, and 4 are mentioned but are not the main focus of this excerpt.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>They are studied in classrooms around the world.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They are designed to last for thousands of years.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They are inspired by great poetry.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Making Inferences question. In examining the role of modern colossal statues as social and political symbols, the professor explains that these very expensive statues are built only when free, taxpaying citizens agree to fund their construction. If these symbols are so costly to build, then the people who agree to fund their construction must place a high value on them. Therefore choice 1 is correct. While it is probably true that important colossal statues are discussed in many classrooms (choice 2), this fact is not mentioned by the professor. The fact that the statues last thousands of years is discussed with regard to ancient, not modern, statues (choice 3). A famous poem is discussed in the lecture, but this poem was inspired by the Statue of Liberty, not the other way around (choice 4).</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>To commemorate the Great Depression</Answer_Choice_3>

<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Detail question. At the opening and again at the closing of his discussion of Mount Rushmore, the professor says that the monument was originally intended as a tourist attraction to bring money to the state of South Dakota. Choice 1 is correct because it paraphrases these statements. The unity of society (choice 2) is addressed in the lecture in connection with colossal statues, and symbolizing this ideal might have been one of the sculptor’s goals. Nevertheless, the professor emphasizes that neither unifying society nor the Great Depression (choice 3) was the original motivation for the state of South Dakota. Choice 4 is incorrect for the same reason: honoring United States Presidents was not the original purpose of the statue; in fact, the monument started out as a depiction of legendary figures of the American West, not United States Presidents.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>To stress the importance of the friendship between France and the United States</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To point out a difference between Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is an Understanding Organization question. Choice 2 is correct because the professor talks about Emma Lazarus’s poem as a second example of how the meaning associated with a monument can change. Before mentioning the poem, the professor points out that the Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France as a gift symbolizing the long friendship between the two countries. But then Lazarus wrote the poem describing the statue as a beacon of welcome for the entire world. The professor says that the poem gave a new meaning to the statue and that this meaning strengthened after the poem was placed on the statue’s pedestal. The professor is not making a general observation about literature and sculpture (choice 1). He mentions the friendship between the United States and France only to set up a contrast with the newer meaning of the statue (choice 3). And he discusses the poem to show a similarity, not a difference, between Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, that similarity being the fact that the symbolism of both monuments has shifted over time.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; You are asked to listen again to part of the lecture and to decide what the professor is implying about the poem.

&lt;i&gt;Back in 1883, Emma Lazarus wrote that famous poem—you know, the one that goes: “Give me your tired, your poor . . . ” and so on and so forth.&lt;/i&gt;

This is a Making Inferences question. To arrive at the correct answer (choice 3), you must understand that the term “and so on and so forth” is typically used when a listener does not need any further information to understand what the speaker is referring to. In this case, the professor assumes that the students are very familiar with the poem, so he does not need to recite more than the first few words of it.</Rationale>

Finding the room empty, she assumes that the class must be meeting elsewhere and goes to the registrar’s office to find out the new location. Choice 2, therefore, is the correct answer. She and the man discuss her change of address (choice 1) only after she learns that the class had been canceled. She does not need to know where the science building is (choice 3) because she has already been there. She does complain about the course being canceled (choice 4), but only after the man informs her about it.</Rationale>

Well, there’s a room assignment sheet on the bulletin board outside this office . . .

Like most replay questions, this is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. In responding to the woman’s question by pointing out that class locations are on display nearby, the receptionist implies that the woman can get that information without his help. Thus choice 4 is correct. At this point in the conversation, the receptionist has not yet checked the computer, which is how he discovers the cancellation (choice 1). It is possible that the receptionist does not know where the science building is (choice 2) and that many room assignments have been changed (choice 3), but the conversation does not touch on either of these possibilities.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>The adaptation of hummingbirds to urban environments</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Concern about the reduction of hummingbird habitat</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The impact of ecotourism on hummingbird populations</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Gist-content question. After the professor establishes loss of wildlife habitat as the general topic, she turns to the hummingbird’s migratory routes as an extended example of the potential impact of losing large habitats and efforts being made to reverse this trend. Thus choice 3 is the correct answer. Changes in the migratory patterns of hummingbirds (choice 1) are discussed only briefly at the end of the lecture as an interesting finding. The adaptation of hummingbirds to urban environments (choice 2) is not mentioned at all. Ecotourism (choice 4) is mentioned only in passing, as one of a number of ways to preserve habitats.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>A decrease in the distance traveled during migration</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Making Inferences question. Choice 2 is the correct answer. The professor explains how land along hummingbird migration routes is being used in farming and cattle raising, among other things. She points out that these activities reduce food availability for hummingbirds and affect their nesting sites. In saying that these human activities all “pose a real threat to the hummingbird population,” she implies a potential decrease in the population if more land is used this way.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>They have supported new laws that punish polluters of wildlife habitats.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>They have replanted native flowers in once polluted areas.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>They have learned to identify various hummingbird species.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Detail question. The professor explicitly states that people have been trying to preserve hummingbird habitats by cleaning up polluted areas and then planting native flowers for the birds to feed on. Thus choice 3 is the correct answer. Building feeding stations (choice 1), punishing polluters (choice 2), and identifying various species (choice 4) are also things that people could conceivably do to help hummingbirds survive, but the professor does not mention any of them.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is another Detail question. Choice 2 is correct. The professor describes a research study designed to collect information about hummingbird migration. This research involves placing lightweight bands on hummingbirds. Information is collected when people who find or recapture the hummingbirds use the phone number on the band to contact the researchers. The study does not involve radio tracking devices (choice 1), counting yearly returns by birds to the same region (choice 3), or comparing the migration routes of old and young birds (choice 4).</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_1>Hummingbirds have totally disappeared from some countries due to recent habitat destruction.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Programs to replant flowers native to hummingbird habitats are not succeeding.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Some groups of hummingbirds have changed their migration patterns.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Some plant species pollinated by hummingbirds have become extinct.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Connecting Content question. A research finding mentioned at the end of the lecture is that some hummingbirds have stopped using certain routes “to reach their destination.” Since the destinations the professor is referring to are migration destinations, she is implying that for some hummingbirds, a change in migration patterns has occurred. Choice 3 is therefore the correct answer. The other answer choices consist of specific statements concerning habitats (choice 1), preservation efforts (choice 2), and food sources (choice 4); nothing the professor says in the lecture supports these specific statements.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>She does not plan to discuss all the details.</Answer_Choice_2>

<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; You are asked to listen again to this part of the lecture:

&quot;So hummingbirds have to rely on plants in their natural habitat. And it goes without saying, but . . . well, the opposite is true as well. Plants depend on hummingbirds too.&quot;

You are then asked what the professor implies when she says this:

&quot;And it goes without saying . . .&quot;

This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. Choice 4 is the correct answer. “It goes without saying” is a common phrase used by speakers to signal that they are about to say (or have just said) something that probably does not need to be said because it is very obvious. The other answer choices are all potential misunderstandings of this phrase.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Gist-purpose question. The correct answer is choice 1. The professor begins the lecture by briefly reviewing a previous discussion about films of the 1920s and 1930s and their hybrid style. Then he turns to a discussion of the style of one particular filmmaker, Jean Painlevé, and spends the rest of the lecture talking about him and his films.</Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Connecting Content question. Choice 4 is the correct answer. Identifying it requires integrating two important pieces of information. The first is the professor’s statement at the beginning of the lecture that films from the 1920s and ’30s do not fit neatly into today’s film categories. The second piece of information comes right afterward, when the professor says that &quot;Painlevé’s films conform to norms of the ’20s and ’30s,” meaning that his films, too, are difficult to categorize.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_2>They depict animals as having both human and animal characteristics.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The narration is scientific and difficult to understand.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The audiences of the 1920s and 1930s were not used to films shot underwater.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Detail question. The professor discusses the confusing aspects of Painlevé’s films at considerable length and focuses, in particular, on the way Painlevé mixes up the audience’s notions of human and animal characteristics. Thus the correct answer is choice 2. </Rationale>

<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is an Understanding Organization question. The reason that the professor discusses sea horses is to illustrate the unusualness of Painlevé’s subject matter. Painlevé’s first film was about sea horses, which are unusual because the males carry the babies. Choice 3 is therefore the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is another Connecting Content question. The professor compares the film styles of Jacques Cousteau and Painlevé in response to an objection raised by the female student. She questions the professor’s characterization of Painlevé’s films as special and points out that other filmmakers, like Cousteau, also made underwater films. The professor emphasizes the uniqueness of Painlevé’s films by explaining that Cousteau’s films were straightforward, fact-based documentaries that met people’s expectations, unlike Painlevé’s films, which mixed fact with fiction in a way that was both unique and confusing. Thus choice 2 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; You are asked to decide what the student is implying when he says this:

&lt;b&gt;Male Student&lt;/b&gt;
Well, maybe I shouldn’t be asking this . . . Uh, but if Painlevé’s films are so special, so good, why haven’t we ever heard of them? I mean, everyone’s heard of Jacques Cousteau . . . 

This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. After listening to what the professor has been saying about Painlevé’s films, the student cannot understand why they are not more popular or better known. The student’s replayed statement suggests that he believes that Painlevé’s films deserve the same level of recognition that Cousteau’s films have received. Thus choice 3 is the correct answer.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_4>To discuss ways to improve his grade</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Gist-purpose question. The correct answer is choice 2. The student opens the conversation by asking the professor about her request for volunteers for an archaeology project. The project’s timing—the middle of the semester—is mentioned later, when the professor says that she would not expect students to travel to a site in the middle of the semester. Choosing the correct answer thus requires the integration of these two pieces of information from different parts of the conversation. Choice 1 is incorrect because the project is voluntary, not an assignment. It takes place during the semester, not during the summer (choice 3). Although the student asks about extra credit, presumably to improve his grade (choice 4), he brings this up as an afterthought, when he hears how much work is involved.</Rationale>

<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is an Understanding the Speaker’s Attitude question. You are asked to identify an opinion that is expressed by the professor. Choice 1 is correct because it paraphrases the professor’s description of the Chauvet drawings as “masterpieces.” The professor only speculates about the &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; religious significance of the drawings, which is different from saying that the drawings &lt;i&gt;probably&lt;/i&gt; reflected the artists’ religious beliefs (choice 2). He mentions Lascaux and Altamira not to compare the sophistication of drawings in those caves with the Chauvet drawings (choice 3), but to compare them in terms of age. Choice 4 misstates the age comparison: the professor believes that the Chauvet drawings are considerably older.</Rationale>

<Question>Compared to other Paleolithic art, what is unusual about the animals painted at Chauvet?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Most of them are horses.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>Many of them are dangerous.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Many of them are shown alongside humans.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>All of them are species that are still found in France.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Detail question. Choice 2 is correct. The professor first notes that the animals represented in most Paleolithic art were large herbivores—plant-eating animals that were probably hunted. He then contrasts these animals with the large, dangerous animals depicted at Chauvet, including rhinoceroses, lions, mammoths, and bears. </Rationale>

<Question>What are two questions about the Chauvet cave artists that the professor raises but cannot answer?

&lt;i&gt;Choose 2 answers.&lt;/i&gt;</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>How they lighted their work area</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>How they obtained pigments for their paints</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>Why they chose to paint certain animals and not others</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Why they placed their art in dark, uninhabited places</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>C,D</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt;&lt;number4&gt; This is another Detail question. The two correct answers come from different parts of the lecture. In the middle of the lecture, the professor discusses a curious aspect of the Chauvet paintings—their location deep inside an inaccessible cave where sunlight cannot reach. He says “We’ll never really know” what led artists to create beautiful art in such a remote place (choice 4). Later in the lecture, he wonders aloud why the cave artists drew rhinoceroses, lions, mammoths, and bears instead of other animals, like birds, fish, or snakes. Here, too, he says, we do not know the reason. Thus choice 3 is also correct.</Rationale>

<Question>What is the lecture mainly about?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>Different ways of magnifying the spectrum of a star</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>How a chemical element was first discovered on the Sun</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>How astronomers identify the chemical elements in a star</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>Why the spectra of different stars are composed of different colors</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>3</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number3&gt; This is a Gist-content question. At the beginning of the lecture, the professor defines spectroscopy and notes its importance to astronomy as a method that allows astronomers to determine the chemical composition of stars. The rest of the lecture is intended to help students understand the technique and how it can be used in this way.  Thus choice 3 is the cprrect answer. Choice 1 is incorrect because the professor merely describes what a magnified spectrum looks like and how it can be used; he does not actually explain how this magnification is achieved technically. Choices 2 and 4 are incorrect because they each represent only a small part of the lecture, not the main topic.</Rationale>

<Question>What does the professor explain to one of the students about the term “radiation”?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>It is defined incorrectly in the textbook.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>It was first used in the nineteenth century.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>It is rarely used by astronomers.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>It does not refer only to harmful energy.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>4</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number4&gt; This is a Detail question. The student expresses a mistaken view about radiation—she thinks that all radiation is harmful. The professor corrects this misimpression first by acknowledging that some forms of radiation, like radiation from the element uranium, are indeed harmful to living organisms. He then gives a general definition of radiation as &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; that spreads out from its source. Finally, he points out that some forms of radiation, like visible light energy, are not harmful. Thus choice 4 is correct.</Rationale>

<Question>What can be inferred about two stars if their spectra have similar spectral line patterns?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>The stars are approximately the same distance from the Earth.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>The stars probably have some chemical elements in common.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>The stars have nearly the same brightness.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>The stars are probably of the same size.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; This is a Making Inferences question. The correct answer is choice 2, and it can be inferred from the professor’s account of the relationship between spectral line patterns and chemical elements. Every chemical element, he explains, has a unique spectral line pattern that corresponds to it, and these spectral line patterns make it possible to identify what the elements are in a star. If two stars are similar in terms of their spectral line patterns, it is reasonable to infer that they are similar in terms of the elements they contain. </Rationale>

<Question>According to the professor, what is the purpose of heating an element in a spectroscopic flame test?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>To cause an element to emit light</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>To study an element in combination with other elements</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>To remove impurities from the element</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To measure an element’s resistance to heat</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; This is a Detail question. The professor explains that spectroscopic flame tests were used to create a library of the visible light spectra produced by various elements that exist in stars. In order to get an element to emit light, the element must be heated. Therefore choice 1 is correct. The other choices describe other reasons a scientist might possibly heat a chemical element in a flame, but the professor does not mention any of them.</Rationale>

<Question>Why does the professor say this?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1>He is about to provide some background information.</Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2>He is about to repeat what he just said.</Answer_Choice_2>
<Answer_Choice_3>He intends to focus on the history of astronomy.</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>He intends to explain two different points of view.</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>1</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number1&gt; You are asked why the professor says this:

&quot;Before we get into that, though, it’s probably a good thing to back up a bit.&quot;

This is an Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. The sentance signals that the professor is about to interrupt the flow of his lecture to provide some information that might help the students better understand the main topic. The correct answer, therefore, is choice 1. Recalling the context of this statement—what the professor said immediately before and immediately after the replay—is important. Before the replay, the professor introduces some abstract and possibly unfamiliar concepts. After the replayed statement, he provides a familiar, concrete analogy that may make the concepts more accessible: a prism breaking visible light into a rainbow of colors. Referring to your notes could therefore be helpful in getting this answer right.</Rationale>

<Answer_Choice_3>To emphasize how important it is for astronomers to study Greek</Answer_Choice_3>
<Answer_Choice_4>To remind the students about the historical background of astronomy</Answer_Choice_4>
<Correct_Answer>2</Correct_Answer>
<Rationale>&lt;number2&gt; You are asked why the professor asks this:

&quot;Any of you happen to be familiar with the Greek word for &lt;i&gt;Sun&lt;/i&gt;, by chance?&quot;

This is another Understanding the Function of What Is Said question. The professor makes two attempts to help students guess that the element in the Sun discovered by a British astronomer in the 1860s was helium. The first hint the professor gives is that the element is common on Earth. When no one is able to identify the element, the professor provides a second hint, which is contained in the replayed statement. The correct answer therefore is Choice 2.</Rationale>

<Question>The following Speaking section of the test will last approximately &lt;b&gt;20 minutes&lt;/b&gt;. To complete it, you will need a recording device that you can play back and listen to your responses.

During the test, you will answer six speaking questions. Two of the questions ask about familiar topics. Four questions ask about short conversations, lectures, and reading passages. You may take notes as you read the passages and listen to the conversations and lectures. You will be told when to begin to prepare and when to begin speaking. You should answer all of the questions as completely as possible in the time allowed.

<Question>Choose a place you go to often that is important to you and explain why it is important. Please include specific details in your explanation.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1></Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2></Answer_Choice_2>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this question, you are asked to talk about a place you like to go often and explain why it is important to you. People who listen to your response should be able to easily follow the progression of your ideas. Responses scored at the highest level contain ideas supported with details and elaboration that go beyond simple structures. For example, the response, “&lt;i&gt;I like this place because it is nice&lt;/i&gt;” does not have enough detail. Why is this place nice? Developing this idea more might look like this: “&lt;i&gt;I like this place because it is quiet and peaceful. Listening to the ocean waves on the beach relaxes me and helps me to relieve stress&lt;/i&gt;.”

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker continues speaking throughout the entire 45 seconds. She speaks clearly using a variety of vocabulary and a wide range of grammar. Her reasons are well developed. She uses specific details about why France is an important place for her. Instead of just saying, “&lt;i&gt;I’m interested in French culture because it is interesting,&lt;/i&gt;” she elaborates by talking about her friend, her interest in French history and culture from a young age, and the food. There is a logical progression of ideas that make the response easy to understand.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This response is sustained and the speech is generally understandable. At times, though, the speaker’s pronunciation makes it difficult to understand the meaning of her ideas. She really gives only one reason why she likes shopping. This reason is used repetitively without much elaboration. Shopping is something she likes very much and makes her feel better. She could have added complexity to her ideas by saying something like “&lt;i&gt;When I go shopping, I usually go with friends, and we have a good time together without thinking about jobs or schoolwork.&lt;/i&gt;” She also makes some basic grammatical errors and uses a limited range of vocabulary.</Rationale>

<Question>Some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in order to get a broad education. Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1></Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2></Answer_Choice_2>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this question, you are asked to make a choice between two given options. In a complete, well-developed response, you should clearly state your choice/preference. You may choose both options, but you must support both of them with reasons that are detailed. If you think taking a variety of courses is better, make sure you explain in detail what your reasons are for having that opinion. Here is an example: “&lt;i&gt;Taking a variety of courses is better because it gives you an opportunity to learn about subjects outside of your field of study. Because so many fields of study are related, you never know when knowledge from one area will be helpful in another.&lt;/i&gt;” This kind of response clearly shows which option was chosen and includes a detailed reason why it was chosen.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker gives a thoughtful, sustained answer with ideas and reasons that progress logically. He speaks fluently and demonstrates good control of grammar and vocabulary, with only minor errors that do not obscure the meaning of his ideas. The speaker very clearly states his opinion that the answer depends on whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student. He continues by giving a detailed reason that supports each perspective.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Although the speaker’s pronunciation is clear, his pace is slow and irregular. The clearest parts of his speech are words that he has taken from the question. He demonstrates very limited vocabulary. His thoughts are understandable at the sentence level, but there are very few connections between sentences. Such connections would help listeners to understand what is being said or enable them to predict what will likely come next. The opinion is stated in the beginning. However, he frequently uses words from the question and repeats the same idea throughout the response.</Rationale>

<Question>The man expresses his opinion of the university’s plan to eliminate the bus service. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1></Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2></Answer_Choice_2>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The university plans to eliminate the bus service because it is too expensive to run and too few students use it. The man disagrees with the university plan. He believes the reason few students take the bus is that the route goes to neighborhoods where students do not live. If the routes were changed, many more students would ride the bus.
The man also disagrees with the way the university plans to use the money it saves on the bus service. Building more parking lots on campus will encourage more students to drive on campus. This would increase noise and traffic on campus.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker gives a clear and coherent response that is detailed and accurate. He speaks quickly, but this does not prevent him from being understood. He very clearly states the man’s opinion and summarizes the man’s reasons for having that opinion. He uses complex grammatical structures and a wide variety of appropriate vocabulary. As a result, his speech seems to flow automatically.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker’s first language moderately influences her pronunciation, intonation, and pacing. This requires some listener effort. She provides content that is relevant to the task, but her limitations in language use hinder her ability to accurately convey relevant details. She fills the entire time with understandable speech. However, she incorrectly repeats throughout the response time that students cannot afford to ride the bus. She also says that few students will drive cars and overcrowd the parking lots. This creates confusion for the listener. The speaker never mentions the man’s concern about increased noise and traffic on campus.</Rationale>

<Question>Explain how the examples of tying shoes and learning to type demonstrate the principle of audience effects.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1></Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2></Answer_Choice_2>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The principle of audience effects suggests that when people are aware of being observed, their behavior changes. Specifically, in the two studies described, people worked faster when they were aware of being observed. In one study, two groups were told to put on shoes that tied. One group was told it would be observed, and the other was not. The group that knew it was being observed tied shoes much faster than the other group. In learning to type, those being observed type faster, but they also make more mistakes than those not aware of being observed.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Click on &quot;High-Level Response&quot; below to hear a high-level response for the question, or &quot;Mid-Level Response&quot; to hear a mid-level response for the question.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker speaks clearly. She identifies the concept of audience effects and the two examples from the listening. She organizes her response in a logical way that leads the listener from one sentence to the next. She supports her response with accurate details and demonstrates a sophisticated level of both grammatical structures and vocabulary. This is evident in the way she smoothly makes the transition from one idea to the next and the efficient use of language to accurately summarize the examples from the listening. There are only very minor errors in language use, and they do not prevent her response from being understood.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker sustains his response throughout. His pronunciation and intonation are affected by the speaker’s first language. These pronunciation errors make it hard to know what he means. The speaker identifies the concept and the two examples, but with inaccuracies. Instead of summarizing each experiment, he combines the summary of both experiments. This causes him to incorrectly conclude that you make more mistakes when you are being watched while tying your shoes. Additionally, the speaker sometimes stumbles when trying to form basic words (&lt;i&gt;slowlier&lt;/i&gt;), which shows a moderate control of grammar and vocabulary.</Rationale>

<Question>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman’s problem. Describe the problem and the two solutions. Then explain what you think the woman should do and why.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1></Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2></Answer_Choice_2>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The problem the student faces is a conflict between an earlier commitment to help with a museum exhibition setup and a more recent opportunity to go on a field trip led by one of her professors. She could talk to Dr. Clark about finding a replacement to help with setting up the museum exhibition. As an alternative, since the field trip doesn’t start until later in the week, the student could try to finish setting up the exhibit before the field trip. (Note: Normally, you are asked to talk about only the &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; solution you support, not both, solutions, as in this example.)
After summarizing the problem and solutions, you should choose the solution you think is best and give a detailed reason. For example, you could say that you think the student should stay to set up the museum exhibit because she should honor the commitment she made to Dr. Clark.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
There are minor pronunciation and intonation errors, but they do not prevent the speaker’s response from being understood. She uses connecting words to mark the progression of ideas. Her control of grammar and vocabulary is evident in the way she efficiently summarizes the situation from the listening. The speaker clearly identifies the problem and both solutions. She organizes her response, so it is easy to follow her ideas from one to the next. She indicates her opinion of what the student should do. Although she runs out of time before she can explain why she holds that opinion, it is clear that she understands the task.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater’s Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The response is generally understandable. The speaker sustains speech throughout the response time. However, the sense of hesitation in the way the response is delivered requires some listener effort. The choppy delivery sometimes makes it difficult to know when one sentence or idea ends and when others begin. The speaker makes a number of errors with simple grammatical structures (&lt;i&gt;very like to, let her to take, make somebody to replace her&lt;/i&gt;). Overall meaning, though, is not greatly affected by these errors. The speaker identifies the problem and describes the two solutions. A higher-level vocabulary would have been helpful to more efficiently summarize the situation. The problem and two solutions are summarized with too much detail, which prevents the speaker from having time to state her preferred solution and give a reason for it.</Rationale>

<Question>Using points and examples from the talk, explain the two definitions of money presented by the professor.</Question>
<Answer_Choice_1></Answer_Choice_1>
<Answer_Choice_2></Answer_Choice_2>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Under the broad definition, money is anything that can be used as payment (as a medium of exchange); for example, coins/bills and barter. If you take a taxi ride, you could use vegetables as payment for the cab ride. Under a narrower definition, money is anything that must be accepted as payment (legal tender). In the United States, coins and bills are legal tender. A taxi driver must accept coins and bills as payment for the taxi ride. Vegetables are not legal tender in the United States, so the taxi driver does not have to accept them as payment.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker’s pronunciation and intonation are highly intelligible. She speaks a little too quickly at times, but the overall meaning is not lost. Her words and ideas flow easily from one idea to the next. She uses complex grammatical structures and a wide range of vocabulary. The speaker fluently summarizes the lecture, accurately recounting the broad and narrow definition. Her response is detailed and sustained. She spends too much time summarizing the first definition and example, so she does not fully explain the second definition and example. However, it is obvious from the apparent ease with which she speaks that she understands the concept and is able to talk about it.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker’s pronunciation is generally clear. She sustains speech and continues to try to elaborate her ideas. The hesitancy and choppiness indicate a lack of control of vocabulary and grammar. This significantly affects the overall intelligibility of the response. She conveys some relevant details, including an almost accurate summary of both definitions of money. However, her response is clearly incomplete. The speaker’s struggle to find the right words to convey her ideas prevents her from efficiently using her time. Neither of the examples is included in the response. Most of her ideas are underdeveloped.</Rationale>

<Question>What kind of reading material, such as novels, magazines, or poetry, do you most like to read in your free time? Explain why you find this kind of reading material interesting.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this question, you are asked to talk about what type of material you like to read in your free time and why you find this material interesting. People who listen to your response should clearly understand what kind of material you read and the reason or reasons it interests you. Responses scored at higher levels contain at least one clear, well-developed reason for the preferred reading material and avoid vague explanations such as “&lt;i&gt;I like to read magazines because they contain a lot of interesting information&lt;/i&gt;.” A more developed response might begin, “&lt;i&gt;I like to read news magazines because they provide more detailed information about current events than television news shows or newspapers can&lt;/i&gt;,” and then continue on to explain how the added details in news magazines are interesting or beneficial. Note that raters are only going to consider how well you explain your interest, not make judgments about what you read. It does not matter whether your favorite reading materials are physics journals or comic books!

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker identifies her preferred reading material—plays—and gives a very well-developed explanation for why she enjoys them. She uses plenty of supporting details and examples in her response. As her answer progresses, she identifies one author, Shakespeare, whose plays she especially enjoys reading, then further explains why his plays are meaningful to her. She uses a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical constructions with ease, and while her pronunciation is not perfect, it is easy to understand.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker states what kind of reading material he likes, but he does not develop his answer with much detail. He could have developed his answer better if he had chosen only one type of material—books or novels. For example, he could have explained what sport he likes to read about in magazines, why he is interested in that sport, and how magazines help him maintain his interest. His speech is easy to understand, but he has minor problems with pacing, often pausing to think of the next word to say. His vocabulary range is somewhat narrow.</Rationale>

<Question>Some students would prefer to live with roommates. Others would prefer to live alone. Which option would you prefer and why?</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this question, you need to state whether you, as a student, would prefer to live with roommates or live alone, and then you need to explain your preference. You should explain your reason or reasons fully and clearly, using details and examples where you can. For instance, you could say you prefer to live with a roommate and then explain one or two reasons, such as having someone to discuss problems with, being able to share the cooking and cleaning, or avoiding loneliness. If you want to talk about the advantages or disadvantages of &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; options and say they are equally good, that is permissible. However, it might be more difficult for you to finish discussing both options in the time allowed.

Click on &quot;High-Level Response&quot; below to hear a high-level response for the question, or &quot;Low-Level Response&quot; to hear a low-level response for the question.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker’s response presents a clear progression of ideas. He chooses to discuss an advantage of living with a roommate before he describes the disadvantages, which, to him, are stronger than the advantage. He gives an example of how a roommate might be a problem, then states his preference—living alone—and relates it to his personal experience. His pronunciation is easy to understand, and he speaks very fluently. A few of his word choices are not precise, but this would not prevent a listener from understanding his ideas.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
For the first part of his response, the speaker is only reading the question aloud and not actually answering it. His pronunciation is strongly affected by his first language, so the listener must make a great effort to try to understand what he is saying. His response is marked by long pauses as he tries to think of the next word to say, indicating that he possesses a very limited English vocabulary. The lowest level of the rubric describes the characteristics of this response.</Rationale>

<Question>The woman expresses her opinion of the university’s plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The woman disagrees with the housing department’s plan to build new student housing off campus. She thinks students will still have to drive to campus to get to class, so there will not be any decrease in the number of cars around campus. She also thinks students will miss opportunities to be involved in on-campus activities, which are just as important as the experience of living in town.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker gives a sustained, coherent response that accurately and efficiently explains the woman’s opinion of the main points of the newspaper article. He did not waste time by including unimportant details from the conversation or reading. His pacing is fluid, and he demonstrates good control of a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary. His pronunciation is exceptionally clear.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker covers all the important points of the woman’s opinion. However, the speaker never states what the university plan is, so she does not make it entirely clear what, in general, the woman in the conversation is disagreeing with. Her response contains some minor errors in word choice, such as &lt;i&gt;assist&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;attend&lt;/i&gt;, but overall she demonstrates good control of both vocabulary and grammar. Her pacing is usually steady, though with a number of hesitations that require listener effort at times.</Rationale>

<Question>Explain how the two examples discussed by the professor illustrate differences in the ways people explain behavior.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
We explain others’ behavior differently from how we explain our own behavior. The professor describes how he thought that the man who cut ahead of him in line was a rude person. This example shows that we tend to explain the behavior of others by attributing it to their character or personality. Then the professor describes how he similarly cut into line but did not think of himself as rude, because he was late for a meeting. This illustrates how we explain our own behavior not in terms of our character, but by attributing it to situational factors. 

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Click on &quot;High-Level Response&quot; below to hear a high-level response for the question, or &quot;Mid-Level Response&quot; to hear a mid-level response for the question.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker clearly shows how the professor’s examples illustrate the idea that we explain other people’s behavior one way and our own behavior in a different way. He covers the main points efficiently in the time allotted. His response is sustained and fluid, and his pronunciation is easy to understand, with only occasional, minor difficulties. There are several minor grammatical errors that do not hinder understanding, and overall he demonstrates good control of grammatical structures.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker is able to cover both of the professor’s examples in a basic way, but he never clearly connects the second example to the concept from the reading (that people explain their own behavior based on situational factors, not character). His pronunciation is easy to understand, but his response is still difficult to follow at times because of his frequent hesitations.</Rationale>

<Question>Using points and examples from the talk, explain how learning art can impact a child’s development.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Learning art skills can have an important impact on the emotional development of young children in two ways. One is by helping them to express complex emotions. Drawing can, for example, help children express emotions that they cannot express in words. The little girl expressed pride when she drew a picture of herself looking proud of learning to ride a bike.

The second way art can help young children is by teaching them persistence. After spending time perfecting an art piece—such as the little boy sculpting a car out of clay—they can see their success.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Click on &quot;High-Level Response&quot; below to hear a high-level response for the question, or &quot;Mid-Level Response&quot; to hear a mid-level response for the question.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker efficiently summarizes the key points from the lecture in order to explain how learning art skills can influence a child’s development. His speech is highly intelligible and fluid, though there are a few minor lapses in flow. His response also demonstrates good control of both basic and more complex grammatical structures as used in spoken language.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker makes major errors in content as he attempts to summarize the lecture. He does not mention the second point—that learning the value of persistence is one of the ways that art can help children’s emotional development. Also, his summary of the first point is inaccurate; he confuses the example for the second point with the example for the first point (helping children express emotions). His pronunciation is generally clear, but his response lacks full coherence; it is not always easy to see how one idea connects to the next.</Rationale>

<Question>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman’s problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you prefer and why.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The student’s problem is that she must take a course to graduate, but the course is not being offered next term, and she is supposed to graduate at the end of next term.

For this task, notice that the question does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; tell you to discuss both of the solutions. After summarizing the problem, you need to say only which &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the solutions from the conversation you prefer and why. If you agree with the first solution, you would say that you think she should take the course at another university. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that although she would have to commute back and forth, the course would be easier than a graduate course, and it might be a good experience for her to meet students from another university.  

If you choose the second solution, you would say that you think she should take the graduate version of the course at her university. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that this way she would not have to waste time commuting, and even if the graduate-level course is more difficult, she would probably learn more, and it would look impressive in her academic record.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Click on &quot;High-Level Response&quot; below to hear a high-level response for the question, or &quot;Mid-Level Response&quot; to hear a mid-level response for the question.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker fulfills the task by summarizing the problem and explaining her preferred solution. She refers to relevant points from the conversation with a coherent progression of ideas. She has chosen to describe both solutions, which the question does not require, but since she is a fluent speaker, she is able to do this as well as support her recommendation within the time limit. Her pronunciation is clear, and although her pace varies at times, it does not require listener effort to follow what she is saying.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker does not demonstrate a high level of fluency. She pauses after every two or three words, which requires the listener to make some effort to follow her ideas. She does explain the problem and gives her preferred solution, although she does not really support her preference for the second solution. Her lack of fluency prevents her from giving a full answer in the time allotted.</Rationale>

<Question>What characteristics do you think make someone a good parent? Explain why these characteristics are important to you.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this question, you should talk about a characteristic or quality of a good parent. You should select one or two characteristics (such as being patient, being kind, being strict) and explain why you think the characteristic is important for a parent to have. For example, if you say being patient helps make someone a good parent, you could explain why by adding “&lt;i&gt;Children make a lot of mistakes as they learn and grow, and parents who are patient don’t make their children nervous or fearful about making mistakes from time to time . . . And that helps them grow into more confident adults.&lt;/i&gt;”

You should be careful to avoid vague responses such as “&lt;i&gt;Parents should be patient because this is good for children&lt;/i&gt;.” Such statements do not make it clear why it is important for parents to be patient.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;The speaker’s pronunciation is clear and her delivery is fluent. She chooses two characteristics—being strict and being loving—and supports each one, though she develops the first one in more detail. She uses a variety of appropriate vocabulary and phrases, such as &lt;i&gt;follow the parents’ lead&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;to look up to.&lt;/i&gt; She is also able to use appropriate word forms, such as &lt;i&gt;strict&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;strictness&lt;/i&gt;, correctly and without hesitation. 

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker talks about three things good parents do: trust their children, listen to their children, and communicate with their children. However, the support for her ideas is vague and unclear; for example, she only says trust is very important but does not explain why. While her pronunciation is easy to understand, she pauses frequently in order to choose the next word, which makes her answer somewhat difficult to follow. Her basic grammar is adequate, but she is unable to use very advanced grammatical constructions; for example, she says &lt;i&gt;children may be better understand&lt;/i&gt; rather than, &lt;i&gt;better understood&lt;/i&gt;, by the parents.</Rationale>

<Question>Some students prefer to work on class assignments by themselves. Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this question, you need to say whether you prefer to work alone or in groups to complete class assignments, and then explain the reason for your preference. You should not simply give a list of reasons, such as “&lt;i&gt;I prefer to work in groups because it is more interesting plus many people help and also you can learn from other people&lt;/i&gt; . . .” It is better if you develop one or two reasons fully. For example, if you prefer to work in groups, you could say, “&lt;i&gt;I prefer working in groups because usually in group work, different people know different things about the topic, and because of that, you get a deeper understanding of the assignment. For example, there was a student from Venezuela in a group assignment I had, and we were supposed to describe how crude oil prices are set. She helped us understand problems in oil production in a much deeper way because her parents worked in oil production . . .&lt;/i&gt;”

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Click on &quot;High-Level Response&quot; below to hear a high-level response for the question, or &quot;Low-Level Response&quot; to hear a low-level response for the question.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This is a fully developed response to the question. She gives two reasons for preferring to work by herself—having strong opinions and managing time well—and gives a clear explanation of why each is more suitable for working alone. Her speech is fluent, and she uses appropriate intonation and stress on certain words (such as &lt;I&gt;I&lt;/I&gt; in&lt;i&gt; the way &lt;B&gt;I &lt;/B&gt;see them&lt;/i&gt;) to convey meaning. She uses advanced-level vocabulary, such as &lt;i&gt;a structured approach,&lt;/i&gt; and high-level grammatical constructions with ease.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
While her pronunciation is clear, this speaker struggles and often fails to come up with words to express her meaning, such as using &lt;i&gt;good things&lt;/i&gt; rather than the more appropriate and specific &lt;i&gt;advantages&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;benefits&lt;/i&gt;. Since she spends time trying to describe benefits of both group work and working alone, she ran out of time before she could support her true preference for working alone, other than saying it allows more independence. Her answer is very choppy and vague. She does not demonstrate that she has command of grammar beyond a very basic level.</Rationale>

<Question>The woman expresses her opinion of the change that has been announced. State her opinion and explain her reasons for holding that opinion.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The woman does not think that Dining Services should stop providing hot breakfast foods. She says that for health, the temperature of the food is not the issue (except on cold days, when warm food is better). She also says that the change will not make breakfasts more affordable, but rather will make them more expensive, since students will have to go off campus (where the prices are higher) to buy the food they want.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;High-Level Response Rater’s Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This response covers all the key points of the article and conversation with great clarity and supporting details. The speaker&apos;s pronunciation is very clear, and he uses good rhythm and intonation. He uses a good variety of vocabulary and idiomatic expressions that help him express his meaning clearly.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker does a fairly good job of explaining the woman’s disagreement with the proposal in the article, but her speech is very choppy (not fluent). She has to pause often to think of the correct word or phrase to say. Sometimes her limited vocabulary prevents her from clearly expressing what she means (for example, the meaning of &lt;i&gt;the offer is their last offer for choosing&lt;/i&gt; is unclear). Her pronunciation is generally easy to understand but occasionally requires listener effort.</Rationale>

<Question>Using the example discussed by the professor, explain what cognitive dissonance is and how people often deal with it.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Cognitive dissonance occurs when people’s beliefs and actions are in conflict with each other. People deal with cognitive dissonance by changing their interpretation of the situation. For example, the professor could not stop playing video games even though he believed it was causing him to fail chemistry. He then told himself that since he wanted to be a sociologist, he did not need to do well in chemistry.

This speaker efficiently and accurately explains the concept of cognitive dissonance and how people deal with it, as in the professor’s example. Her speech is fluid, and she uses intonation and stress effectively to convey emphasis and meaning—for example, by stressing the words &lt;i&gt;actions&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;interpretation&lt;/i&gt; as a contrast to demonstrate how people deal with cognitive dissonance (by changing their interpretation of a situation rather than their actions). She uses advanced-level vocabulary with accuracy and ease.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
In this response, the speaker conveys the relevant information in the task, but not always with precision. For instance, when describing the professor’s example, instead of saying the professor changed his &lt;i&gt;interpretation&lt;/i&gt; of the situation, she says he began to &lt;i&gt;make up his own opinion.&lt;/i&gt; Her pronunciation is clear, but her speech is marked by many pauses and hesitations.</Rationale>

<Question>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman’s problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which of the solutions you recommend and explain why.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The woman won an award, but the ceremony to accept the award is at the same time as her biology exam.

For this task, notice that the question does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; tell you to discuss both of the solutions. After summarizing the problem, you need to say only which &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the solutions from the conversation you prefer and why. If you agree with the first solution, you would say that you think she should write a paper instead of taking the exam. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that even though this would take a lot of time, it would allow her to attend the ceremony, which is important because her parents would like to watch her get the award. 

If you choose the second solution, you would say that you think she should have someone else go to the ceremony and accept the award in her place. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that writing the paper would take too much time from studying for her other classes, which are important for her success as a student, and that her parents would surely understand and support that decision.

This speaker is very fluent and conveys a great deal of information in the time allotted. Although she needed to state and support only the solution she is recommending, she chose to describe both solutions in her answer before recommending one. Because she is so fluent, describing both did not cause her to run out of time before she finished her response. She fully supported her recommendation. Her speech is easy to understand and well paced. She also demonstrates good control of both basic and more advanced grammar and vocabulary.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The speaker runs out of time before she can fully support the solution she is recommending, which is to write the five-page paper. She also does not explain the problem very clearly at the beginning, never saying that the exam and award ceremony are at the same time. Her pronunciation is quite clear, and her pacing is good at the beginning but then becomes slower and choppy by the end of her response.</Rationale>

<Question>Using the examples from the talk, explain how persuasive strategies are used in advertising.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Advertisers persuade people to buy their products by using persuasive strategies. One strategy is repetition of information (which may not be true information), such as when an advertisement for a small car keeps repeating that it has plenty of room. Another strategy is to use celebrities because people trust them. For example, a famous race car driver might be used in an advertisement for a car (to give the impression the car is fast, even if it is not).

The speaker conveys all of the main and supporting points from the lecture. His speech is clear and fluid, and although he does not pronounce &lt;i&gt;subtle&lt;/i&gt; correctly, this is a minor error that does not interfere with overall understanding of his speech. His pacing slows down at times as he attempts to recall information, but it is still easy to follow what he is saying. He also uses a variety of advanced-level vocabulary and grammatical constructions with good control.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Level Response Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This speaker discusses both advertising strategies described in the lecture, but in a vague way that is sometimes difficult to understand. For instance, he never mentions that the first example refers to a car advertisement, so it is unclear what he means when he says the message that &lt;i&gt;lots of your friends have space in it&lt;/i&gt; is repeated. His pronunciation is easy to understand, but he pauses frequently throughout his response and demonstrates only a limited vocabulary range and control of grammar.</Rationale>

<Question>&lt;b&gt;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.&lt;/b&gt;</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;b&gt;Topic Notes&lt;/b&gt;
This topic, in effect, equates independence with living apart from one’s family.
Both broader and narrower definitions of independence and “nonindependence” are acceptable as possible responses to the given topic, even though a majority of writers will write to the dichotomy presented by the question. Some writers take a general overview, and their choices and examples are general and “philosophical.” Others use specific personal examples or personal narratives in their approach to the topic. Some writers take a specific side of the issue, and others approach the topic by discussing conditions under which it is better to move away and conditions under which a young adult might do better to stay longer with the family. All these approaches are valid, on-topic responses and are judged by the raters on their merits according to the scoring guidelines for this task type.

Every young adults will grow and live apart from their parents to form their own families. The ages for those young adults to be independent depends on each person. Some people may have to live longer with their parents and some others may not. This essay will discuss the issue of independent life and living with their families for a longer time. 
&lt;tab&gt;Most young adults prefer to have a separate or independent life from their parents or families as soon as possible. This is because they have a strong urge for freedom in doing what they desire. But in fact many of them fail. This should not be surprising since often they are actually not ready mentally although they are physically ready. It is widely understood that to live independently requires a lot of energy and is not easy at all. In this twenty first century, people may need more and more preparation because competition is increasing rapidly. An observation shows that many University graduated students are unemployed. Therefore, they will not be able to support and fulfill their necessities. 
&lt;tab&gt;So living independently at an early age is not suitable for all young adults, some young adults may need to take more time to prepare themselves before going out to struggle. Young adults need to be ready to support themselves. Taking time to get more education and living with their families for a longer time may lead them to a better independent life because they will be well prepared for the hard-life outside. Still, living with their families for *too* long will not be a good idea because they could get to used to it and tend to be less independent. 
&lt;tab&gt;The time to live independently depends on the person himself. He or she must decide whether they are ready to leave their parents to have an independent life or not. The decision will vary from one person to another. A person should judge that he is capable of fulfilling his needs without being dependent on his parents; this indicates that he is ready for his independent life. Otherwise he might need to stay longer with his parents.
 
&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
This well-developed essay meets all the criteria for earning a score of 5. The writer develops the topic through a detailed discussion of independence and of the suitability of living independently. The essay is unified and coherent. Sentence structure is varied, especially in paragraphs 2 and 3. The writer does not use high-level vocabulary, but word choice is correct throughout. There are minor errors (“University graduated students,” “fulfill their necessities”), but these in no way interrupt the flow or meaning of the essay.

Independence! Who doesn’t want independece? But the bigger question is how much of an independence is being discussed here? Generally, when teenagers grow up, their needs and habit of living change. Some would like their parents to be in control of the major decisions of their lives, while on the other hand, some would not like their parents to be involved in any sort of decision making process of their lives. In my opinion, the young adults should always consult their parents as their guides. I will try to demonstrate my point in the following paragraphs. 
&lt;tab&gt;Let’s assume a teenager grows up into a young adult. Now a major decision that he/she might have had to make was to what college/university they were going to attend. If we assume that the person seek complete independence from the early age, then they are generally going to make the decision themselves. But even if they made this decision by themselves, what is the probability that this is the best decision. We all would agree that the best lesson learned is from a mistake, but why even let that happen? This is the most important decision they would have to make so far, and if they don’t ask around, if they don’t look at the wider picture, how are they supposed to end up at their very best opportunity? This, is what is known as a making/breaking point because this decision of theirs can make or break a very powerful potential future. 
&lt;tab&gt;Now, suppose they passed the first make/break point. Then comes another one when they are going to marry. Normally, in the western culture, the man and the woman choose their marriage partners themselves, so this is not much of an important issue here. But, what about the cultures that predominantly have arranged marriages? In that case, choosing a husband or a wife could be a huge decision, because generally the marriages are not as easily broken as in the western culture. So, when it comes to this point, one would definitely want to know their parents thinking and their previous experience. This could come in very handy when one has a choice to make. 
&lt;tab&gt;To sum it up, it is very good idea to ask for parents guides, and is never a bad a idea to give up a part of independence for a better future. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
This essay has a rather informal, conversational tone and an “argument” that is coherently and fully developed. Sentence structure is varied throughout, and the writer consistently demonstrates command of language and English idioms, especially by using various informal expressions (“Let’s assume,” “We all would agree,” “can make or break,” “come in very handy”). The essay meets all the criteria for a score of 5.

There are different opinion regarding how long young adults should live with their parents. Some argues that the sooner a young adults become independence is the better while other think that it will be beneficial if they can live with their parents longer. In my opinion both have positive and negative sides. This essay will provide arguments for each case. 
&lt;tab&gt;Some young adults favor for leaving their parents soon. They want to live free, independence from their parents’ supervision. The good thing about being independence as soon as possible is that they can learn how to live by themselves. They must think how to support their living, otherwise they will still need the help of their parents and can not be independence. Living in their own will teach them how to be tough in facing real difficulties. But, staying away from parents soon could also lead to negative behaviour if the young adults can not control themselves. They might think that they can do whatever they want with the friends they like. If their friends give bad influence on them, no one will warn them and they can have problems. Thus, I will agree for young adults to become independence as soon as possible if they are already mature enough and able to control themselves. Parents can help to judge this before they release them. 
&lt;tab&gt;In the case of young adult is not mature enough, I believe that staying with parents will be better. Parents can provide guidance and help when their children need it. But, if the children is become too dependent on their parents, they will have difficulties in their older lives of becoming independece as the parents will not be available for them anymore. So parents in some way should teach their children about independence, for example by giving them responsibilities that should be handled without supervision. 
&lt;tab&gt;Based on those arguments, I would like to say that either way could be better that the other depending on the maturity of young adults themselves. If they are mature and have self-control then living independently is better, otherwise they better stay with their parents until ready. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
The points made in this essay are thoroughly developed and concretely supported. The essay is well organized and coherent, with a nice flow. What keeps the response from scoring a 5 is the number of noticeable errors in structure and word choice: “Some argues,” “favor for leaving,” “Living in their own,” “become independence,” “if the children is become too dependent.” None of these errors interferes with meaning, but their quantity and effect earn the essay a score of 4.

Independence from the family at early stages of life is a common phenomena exists in our society. Moving out from the family house to live on your own in early ages of your adult life has an advantages and disadvantages. However, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. 
&lt;tab&gt;Independency is generally good and helpful for the individual, because it teaches individuals how to take care of different responsibilities, and how to handle things by yourself. People needs to know how to live independently of others, because eventually they will have to. So, the desire to get your independence from your family when you are young adult is good because it shows the some kind of individual maturity for being aware of the ultimate situation, when you have to move out and live on your own. 
&lt;tab&gt;On the other hand, adults should consider moving out when they are sure that they are ready for it. Being ready includes being financially, physically, and psychologically ready. One major advantage for staying with your parents is financially advantage. Because one gets to save money between the residency and daily living issues. 
&lt;tab&gt;Nowadays, life has become harder for the new generations to live and keep up with. And in order to do that, individualls needs to be fully equiped in terms of education, support, and maturity. And by staying with the family, one would not have to worry about a lot of issues, instead, one will concerntrate more on getting equiped for the next step in his life, which is moving out and getting independent of others. 
&lt;tab&gt;In conclusion, although moving out when you are still a young adult to live independently from the family has some good point, the disadvantages of it overcome these good points. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
This essay is clearly organized and unified, though it does remain on a fairly abstract level. It is also generally well developed. Sentence structure is varied, but there are noticeable errors in syntax and expression (“has an advantages,” “is financially advantage,“ “Because one gets to save money between the residency and daily living issues,” “getting independent of others”). These errors earn this essay a score of 4.

For example, house’s responsabilities or pays. Secound, When peoples live with their parents they don’t expend a lot money for haouse or food. Third, they belief that their family is a great company. But in the other hand, when people live along have important advantage. For example, They live independient, they don’t heve limitation in their own house.

&lt;tab&gt;Both live independient and live with your parents have many different disadvantage. On the first points of view, live independient, the most important problem is money and expensive. For example, right now young adults need to find a good job for live in a good place because rents are expensive. It is the same with food and services.

This essay is somewhat developed and is longer than the average essay with a score of 3. It has a coherent organization based on describing the pros and cons of living apart from one’s parents and living with them, with supporting points. In some cases, however, this approach leads to redundancy, especially toward the end of the essay. Additionally, even discounting typographical mistakes, the various errors clearly reveal weakness in command of language (“Live with your parents have many differents advantage,” “the most important problem is . . . Expensive”). Meaning is also sometimes obscured (“house’s responsabilities or pays,” “they need to work in the house along because don’t have company”).

Young adults show different patterns of behavior when they have to decide whether continuing to live with their family or not. For instance, in United States young adults prefer to live separated from they parents as soon as possible. This tendency reflects wises of freedom and independence. Altough these behavior has remarkable advantages and disadvantage, the advantage can overwhelm the negative effects. 
&lt;tab&gt;It is important to recognize that by living separated from parents or family can be more risked than living with them. Many young adults are victims of group pressure and gangs because of theirs parents absence. 
&lt;tab&gt;However, a significant advantage of living by onself is that people develop ledearship skills. Individuals that live by themselves learn to do and sustain their own decisions. On the contrary, people who live with their parents are more shy and less confident. For instance, many of the greatest world leaders are or have been people that were separated from their parents when they were kids. 
&lt;tab&gt;Another advantage of living indepently is that people can fully develop their creative potential. When people is forced to difficult situations, they can surprise us with outstanding abilities and values that otherwise remained hidden. A good example are blind people, these person show a remarkable ability for art and music. In a similar way, when parents are absent or too away for help, individuals manage to survive and be successful.

Though slightly stronger than the average essay with a score of 3, this essay fails to earn a score of 4 mainly because of errors that obscure meaning (“reflects wises of freedom and independence”). Also, connections among ideas are not always completely clear.

Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of another animal or group of animals. Altruism is the opposite of selfishness; individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves.

Examples of altruism abound, both among humans and among other mammals. Unselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangers to the donation of body organs to family members, and even to strangers. Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another, yet provide little reward to the one performing the act.

In fact, many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food, or even their life, to assist other members of their group. The meerkat, which is a mammal that dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa, is often cited as an example. In groups of meerkats, an individual acts as a sentinel, standing guard and looking out for predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as a hawk approaching the group, it gives an alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter. By standing guard, the sentinel meerkat gains nothing—it goes without food while the others eat, and it places itself in grave danger. After it issues an alarm, it has to flee alone, which might make it more at risk to a predator, since animals in groups are often able to work together to fend off a predator. So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of other members of the meerkat’s group.

You should understand the meaning of &lt;i&gt;altruism&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;altruistic acts.&lt;/i&gt; The definitions are given in the passage: &lt;i&gt;altruism&lt;/i&gt; describes behavior that is the opposite of selfishness; it is behavior that benefits another individual or the group with no reward. The lecturer questions whether the examples meet the definition.

A high-scoring response will include the following points made by the lecturer:

[[T1_W_T1_R]]
Responses scoring 4 and 5 discuss altruistic/nonaltruistic aspects of the three 
points in the table: human organ donation, meerkat sentinel eating behavior, and 
meerkat sentinel ability to escape.

Score 5 Essay &lt;/b&gt;
The lecture completely refutes the passage. It is said in the lecture that, the perceived acts of altruism are nothing more than sneaky methods of gaining advantage for one’s self.Contrary to the belief in the passage that sentinels risk their lives for the cause of the whole group, the professor says that the meerkat sentinels are in fact less prone to outside threats. The alarm sentinels give off causes to group to move rashly which draws the predators attention towards them, thus drawing away the attention from the sentinels. The lecture refutes the fact that these meerkats are altruistic in the sense that they gain nothing in exchange of their services. In fact, researches have shown that they have a full stomach as they perform this “altruistic” duty and have a better chance of escaping from danger because they witness it ifrst Proffesor also offers a different underlying motivation that causes people to believe that acts such as donating an organ or sharing food with someone in need are altruistic. She says that people gain appreciation as a result of such acts, which may be deemed by some much more important than materialistic gains.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
This answer meets all the criteria for a level 5 response to an integrated task. The writer does a good job of selecting, framing, and interweaving points from the lecture and reading, explicitly and fluently presenting accurate connections between the relevant points. All three points made by the lecturer are included. Language is used accurately and effectively, and the overall piece is well organized. 

&lt;b&gt;Score 4 Essay &lt;/b&gt;
Baed on the lecture, meerkats actually do not sacrifice themselves by becoming a sentinel. Firstly, the meerkats that become a sentinel usually eats before. Secondly, these meerkats usually standing guard near their burrows. As a result, when a predator is seen, they raise an alarm and reach a safe place before the other meerkats that hunt for food. This shows that these meerkats do not put themselves in danger. In fact, the lecturer warned that the the alarm raised by these meerkats could be harmfull for the other meerkats. One of the reason is that the responses of the other meerkats to the alarm might attract attention from the predator. Based on these reasons, meerkats can not be used as an example of a mammal that performs altruistic behavior. 
&lt;tab&gt;The lecture also pointed out that, it is not always true that individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothings for themselves. For example, when a man give one of his/her kidney to a family member or even a stranger, his/her self-worth increase. He/she feels usefull for other people. Therefore, he/she gain something from his/her action. 
&lt;tab&gt;In sum, altruism behavior in animal and human is questioned. It is difficult for individuals sacrificies its own interest without gain anything for themselves. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
This response includes all the main points of the lecture. The first paragraph begins with a clear statement that sentinel meerkats do not sacrifice themselves. There are strong concluding statements in each of the first two paragraphs that are quite explicit about the import of the sentinel behavior and the organ donation. The connections to the reading could be stronger. The writer says that the sentinel meerkat “eats before,” but does not make an explicit contrast to the passage that says that sentinel meerkats go without eating. The conclusion in the final paragraph is vague (“altruism . . . is questioned”). On balance then, this response is a level 4, with minor vagueness and omission. In terms of language, there are a number of minor errors: “themself,” missing verb in the sentence beginning “Secondly,” “One of the reason,” “a man give,” “It is difficult for individuals sacrificies.”

&lt;b&gt;Score 3 Essay &lt;/b&gt;
Acording to the lecture, examinig closely to the eating habits of meerkats, these animals are not altruistic, mainly because the sentinel before standing guard eats. So that it has a full stomach. Another fact is that the sentinel, being the first that sees the predator, is able to be the first in escape. Also the other meerkats that are hunting and looking for food are the ones in danger. Considering the altruistic human acts, the donation of body organs shouldn’t be considered like that, mainly because when a person donates an organ he or she receives appreciation and recognition of society. 
&lt;tab&gt;Because of this points the lecture might make the reader doubt, mainly because the eating habits of the meerkats have been studied closely, giving arguments in order to justify that meerkats aren’t doing altruistic acts. 
&lt;tab&gt;The other argument about human and their altruistic actions sounds logical and a situiation in which a person would donate organs just to get appreciation of society couls be probable. 
&lt;tab&gt;Because of this both, reading and lecture, are completely opposite, might make the user doubt and reflect more about altruism. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
This response is at level 3. On the positive side, the response includes all the facts of the sentinel meerkat from the lecture as well as organ donation. However, it is very vague in how it relates (see the Level 3 description in the Scoring Guide) the various points in the lecture to the points in the reading. There is no clear reference to the claim in the reading that the sentinel is sacrificing food or any explanation of the other meerkats as being in danger. The statement commenting on organ donation, “The other argument about human and their altruistic actions sounds logical and a situation in which a person would donate organs just to get appreciation of society couls be probable,” is not very clear.

&lt;b&gt;Score 2 Essay &lt;/b&gt;
Alturism is considered an act of selfishness. A research has been made, that shows the difference of alturism between humans and a special kind of mammal which is the meerkat. There is one of the meerkat that acts as a sentinel (having eaten before going to his sentinel place), and when it it aware that a predator is coming, he instantly gives a loud cry, and makes the others to run away to protect themselves. They do not get anything for their profit (the sentinels profit but he just stays there to protect it specie. 
&lt;tab&gt;The other example that is given, is with humans. A clear example was given to show how selfishless works in humas beings. When a person, wants to donate an organ to somebody who is part of the family or not, may be that person expects the tfamily of the person tha has received the organ to give him or her thanks because of that favour. So, in that sense they make clear that there is a sense of selfishness in human beings, because they expect something back. However, meerkats, do not have a sense of alturism, they just do their job without expecting anything back from their community. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
The best part of this response is the explanation of the lecturer’s point that organ donation can be seen from a selfish point of view. However, it misrepresents the concept of altruism and is confused about the meaning of the information from the lecture about the sentinel’s having eaten. The response misrepresents the point of the lecture by saying that humans are selfish but meerkats are truly altruistic. Because of the significant inaccuracies about both the lecture and the reading, this response is at level 2. 

&lt;b&gt;Score 1 Essay &lt;/b&gt;
The lecture said about altruism. It happen both animal and human. First, the meerkat is a good example of altruism for animal. They have special eatting habit. The meerkat which guard and look out predator is full stomach. After finish standing guard they eat some food while other meerkat guard from predators. When they find predators then they alarm to others to hide into the shelter. Also, human is altruistic animal. People share their food with strangers or they donate food or clothing even body organs. It stated both human and animal are altruism. 
&lt;tab&gt;This lecture make our easy to understand and organize this lecture in mind. It shows short summary about this reading, and also give us some detail information. That is outlind of this reading. In addition, every contents is related to the reading, and also offer some more information. For this reason we can make sure about this reading. 

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments &lt;/b&gt;
Even though this response seems to include some information from the lecture (the fact that the guard meerkat “is full stomach”), it does not show how the information undermines the notion of altruism in meerkats; if anything, it is somehow construed as supporting the concept of meerkat altruism. The second paragraph contains severe language problems and communicates nothing to fulfilling the task. For these reasons, this is a level 1 response.</Rationale>

<Question>&lt;b&gt;Passage&lt;/b&gt;

Professors are normally found in university classrooms, offices, and libraries doing research and lecturing to their students. More and more, however, they also appear as guests on television news programs, giving expert commentary on the latest events in the world. These television appearances are of great benefit to the professors themselves as well as to their universities and the general public.

Professors benefit from appearing on television because by doing so they acquire reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider audience than they have on campus. If a professor publishes views in an academic journal, only other scholars will learn about and appreciate those views. But when a professor appears on TV, thousands of people outside the narrow academic community become aware of the professor’s ideas. So when professors share their ideas with a television audience, the professors’ importance as scholars is enhanced.

Universities also benefit from such appearances. The universities receive positive publicity when their professors appear on TV. When people see a knowledgeable faculty member of a university on television, they think more highly of that university. That then leads to an improved reputation for the university. And that improved reputation in turn leads to more donations for the university and more applications from potential students.

Finally, the public gains from professors’ appearing on television. Most television viewers normally have no contact with university professors. When professors appear on television, viewers have a chance to learn from experts and to be exposed to views they might otherwise never hear about. Television is generally a medium for commentary that tends to be superficial, not deep or thoughtful. From professors on television, by contrast, viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight.

You should understand the reasons presented in the lecture for why it is not necessarily good that professors appear on television. The lecturer questions each of the benefits mentioned in the reading: about the professor’s reputation, about the professor’s time, and about educating the public.

A high-scoring response will include the following points made by the lecturer that address the points made in the reading passage:

[[T2_W_T1_R]]

The passage introduced three reasons why professors should appear on TV: gaining reputation for the professor, for the college, and to educate the general public. However, the lecture disagrees.
&lt;tab&gt;Professors who appear frequently on TV are not generally viewed as a serious scholar. As a result, those professors will receive less invitation to attend academic conferences or less likely to receive research grant. This seriously hinders the professor’s opportunity to further grow as a researcher
&lt;tab&gt;Professors who frequently appear on TV also has negative effect on students and the university. Appearing on TV takes a lot of time to prepare, including preperation for the material, transportation time, and even time to dress up. This precious time can also be used to teach class, help students, or even do further research. As a result, professors who appear on TV waste a lot of time that they can contribute to teaching and research.
&lt;tab&gt;Professors appearing on TV doesn’t usually help educating the general public. The TV network is not interested in having the professor explaining the intellectual substances of their researches. Rather, they are interested in having them explain some basic background information or history. This type of information can be easily presented by a serious reporter who has done his work properly.
&lt;tab&gt;Because of the above reasons, it is highly questionable whether professors appearing on TV has any advantage. In fact, it could bring negative consequence both to the professors themselves and the universities they teach.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
This response successfully conveys all three of the main points from the lecture. The response is well organized and developed. Explicit connection between the reading passage and the lecture is explained in the first and final paragraphs. In each body paragraph, the writer opens with a topic sentence that captures how the lecture point opposes the point made in the reading passage in general, and the writer proceeds to develop the lecturer’s point using relevant details and examples. The language used by the writer is not perfect; there are minor grammatical errors in subject-verb agreement and preposition use (“Professors . . . Has negative effect,” “preperation for the material,” “the universities they teach”). However, note that the Scoring Guide for the integrated task allows level 5 responses to contain occasional minor errors that do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections. The errors in this response do not interfere with meaning or disrupt the flow of the response.

&lt;b&gt;Score 4 Essay&lt;/b&gt;
The reading passage was talking about the advantages of being on TV as a professor. They say that apperaing on television will increase the reputation of a professor. But in the lecture the professor was talking about disadvantages on being on TV as a Professor. At first, it is not good for a professor to be on TV. Because when he apears on TV his reputation among the other Professors decrease. This is the effect of entertaining instead of making researches. Under Professors you are rated by your reasearches and speeches on events. Other professors think that a professor should make reasearches instead of being a TV celebraty.
&lt;tab&gt;Another reason against professors on TV is, that it takes to much time. When they are on TV, they have to prepare for the interview and they have to travel to the studio and so on. In this time they can not make researches and look after their students. It is important to any professor to look after the students. Then if a professor is always away, he will get a bad reputation among the students. And without students he will lose his job.
&lt;tab&gt;This stands in opposite to the reading. In the article they wrote that it is good to be on TV, because you can reach a wider audience. You can present academic topics to a new audience. And so you give people a chance to hear about topics they have never herad befor. But the Problem is that it is superficial. And this is the point critizised in the lecture. The TV networks do not want to educate the people. They want to entertain the people. So for a professor a TV Show is wasting time.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
The opening sentences of this response provide an effective introduction to a discussion of the three points. The main idea of the first point, that professors who appear on television may lose their reputation among their colleagues, is clearly stated, but the writer does not mention the consequences of a professor’s lost reputation. The statement that professors are “rated by researches and speeches on events” is unclear. The second idea, that professors who appear on television do not spend enough time on research and teaching, is well developed. However, the conclusion that “without students he will lose his job” is not mentioned in the lecture and seems somewhat overstated. In the third paragraph, the point concerning possible benefits of these television appearances to the public is summarized quite well, but there are minor structural flaws. For example, the first sentence (“This stands in opposite to the reading.”) suggests that the paragraph will refer back to information that was stated before, but a new topic is then introduced. Overall, the response summarizes the lecture and how it relates to the reading passage quite well. However, the fact that some details from the lecture are left out or conveyed imprecisely, along with minor problems in the connection of ideas and language errors that occasionally interfere with clarity, all contribute to the score of 4 for this response.

&lt;b&gt;Score 3 Essay&lt;/b&gt;
The question which is asked is to know if the apparition of a professor on television is a good or a bad think? On this point, the text and the lecture completely disagree.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
First, we can think that it is a good thing for the professors themselves. It seems to be something logical because today a lot of people want to be known and the television is perhaps the best thing to be known. But what the lecture say is that such a professor don’t have a good reputation. People think they are not very serious when they pass on television. The effect is that they are no more invited to important conferences.
&lt;tab&gt;In what concerned the students and the university, the text shows the facts that some of these apparitions can bring some donation to the university, what is very good. But in the other hand according to the lecture, this professor spend a lot of time travelling and during that time, he isn’t available for the students or for the researches and the university lose therefore some money.
&lt;tab&gt;Finally for the public himself, they could learn some interesting things and it could be a very big chance because a lot of these persons haven’t had the chance going in the university. But it is true that such intervention isn’t often best as something that a journalist could prepare.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
The writer organizes the response fairly well. After a brief introduction, each reading passage point is briefly summarized and then followed by ideas from the related point in the lecture. However, the response earns a score of 3 because the writer’s summaries of the lecture suffer from several problems. There is imprecision (the idea that “people” rather than fellow academics think the professor appearing on television is not serious); there is omission (the idea that television networks are not interested in in-depth lectures is missing); and there is poor connection of ideas (the idea that a university loses “some money” is not connected to the idea that television appearances take away from professors’ time at the university). Most importantly, there are lapses of clarity due to the writer’s poor language control. Errors in word choice (“pass on television,” “intervention isn’t often best as something”) obscure meaning to such an extent that the lecturer’s response to the first point is conveyed only vaguely, and the response to the last point is completely unclear. Although the writer of this response may have had a good grasp of many ideas he or she wanted to write about, he or she failed to communicate those ideas clearly to the reader.

The lecture was about the same main point as the reading passage. But it’s offer an other view point. Indeed it’s realy interessante to see the two explainations.
In the reading passage the TV is presented like really beneficts for all the univercity. It’s really good for the professor an the campus. But the professor from the lecture make advertising. She thinks that it’s not really good for all. A professor spends a lot of time too make a television appereance. And may be it’s not his rolle. He is payed to make cours and reasarch. The student could be the loser of this association. Nevertheless the television could have beneficts. In fact when a professor is on TV, he raise the reputation of the university and he could have more sponsor for his reasarch. And the public haven’t the best course.
&lt;tab&gt;To conclude the television appearances must be take with becarefully and not too superficialy. In this way the relation beetween the universery and the TV will be profitable.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
This response earns a score of 2 primarily because it summarizes only one of the main points from the lecture. The writer discusses the point that television appearances require a lot of time from professors who may then neglect their teaching and researching duties. This is developed with a fair amount of detail, although there are usage errors (“the TV is presented like really beneficts for all the univercity,” “the loser of this association,” “the public haven’t the best course”) that obscure the writer’s meaning to some degree. There is brief mention of benefits to the professor and the public, but these points are not developed or clear. The connection between the reading passage and the lecture is also misrepresented, and the overall topic (professors appearing on television) is not clear. A reader who is not already familiar with the reading passage and the lecture would not understand what the response is about.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</Question>
<Rationale>&lt;b&gt;Topic Notes&lt;/b&gt;
This topic requires you to write about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do.  If you agree with this statement, you should present examples and reasons.  For example, young people may tend to go out more and participate in fun activities while older people may tend to stay at home more.  Another reason that older people may enjoy life less is because they have more responsibilities and pressure from work, family, and money than young people.  A third reason might be that young people are more physically fit and able to enjoy more activities than older people.

	If you disagree with this statement in your response, you should present examples and reasons that older people enjoy life more.  For example, older people may better know what satisfies them and makes them happy than young people do.

	Some good responses explain that the group that enjoys life more depends on where they live.  All of these approaches can be developed into a good response.

People often complain about seing themselves becoming older too quickly. But does that mean that they are enjoying their lives less than they did before? Personally, I rather disagree with this statement. It would probably be more accurate to say that every time of a person’s life is worth being lived and enjoyed.
&lt;tab&gt;There is no denying that young people have far less responsibilities with, for instance, family and work. Thus, they can spend more time on their hobbies than people who are working all day long and who have to care about their children at night when they come home. But one cannot overlook that having a family to care about can be considered as a satisfying pleasure in itself. Besides, many people find fullfillment in their work and enjoy spending most of their time on it.
&lt;tab&gt;Moreover, it is customary to say that older people tend to have more health problems than teenagers or students do. However, it is well worth noticing that this assertion cannot be taken as a general rule, as also many young people develop painfull illnesses. A striking example of a disease which tends to affect more and more teenagers is back ache, because they are sitting for too long periods of time and doing too little sport to compensate. Consequently, the argument supporting that good health makes life more enjoyable when you are young may be called into question.
&lt;tab&gt;In addition to that, one should not forget that today’s teenagers are expected to take important decisions about their future at an early age, and that they have to cope with heavy responsibilities even before getting their first school degree. As it becomes more and more difficult to find a job these days, young people have to worry about what to study and they even often have to fix priorities according to what the job market offers, and not according to their personal preferences.
&lt;tab&gt;Last but not least, one cannot forget that after working hard for long years, people retire and are then given the chance to concentrate on their centers of interest and hobbies again. Up to a certain point, when taking into account the arguments of the previous paragraph concerning the early responsibilities teenagers have to assume, pensioners are even more free to enjoy their lives without thinking of potential problems of the future.
&lt;tab&gt;To put it in a nutshell, that all amounts to saying that there is no period of time in a person’s life which is more prone to hapiness than the others. People only have to learn to make the best of every situation and of what they have . . . Even if it is easier said than done!

This well-structured essay meets all the criteria needed to earn a score of 5. It takes issue with the statement presented. It first develops its points somewhat inductively. In paragraph 2, it presents reasons why younger people may enjoy life more (fewer responsibilities) but ends by explaining why these same responsibilities can be fulfilling for older people. Paragraph 3 advances the claim that older people have more health problems and goes on to explain that young people can have health issues as well. The last point developed in paragraphs 4 and 5 discusses how younger people have to worry about their studies and their future, while older people who are retired are free to enjoy their lives—their hobbies and interests. Sentence structures are varied and complex, and the response displays good vocabulary choice; these allow the writer to convey meaning accurately. There is a minor organizational issue: the writer makes the statement in the introductory paragraph, “It would probably be more accurate to say that every time of a person’s life is worth being lived and enjoyed,” and also concludes with this same notion. This is a bit misleading because the focus of the body paragraphs is not on enjoyment at all stages of life—much is discussed about things that are not so pleasant at particular times of life. However, this misleading statement is not a major issue, and the bulk of the essay is a well-organized, coherent discussion of why it cannot be said that younger people enjoy life more than older people do.

Personally I agree to the statement “young people enjoy life more than older people do”, in that I believe the younger you are, the more possibilities you have of entertainment. The latter is a way to enjoy life, however it is not the only way. But depending on one’s age, there are different ways of having fun experiences and interests.
&lt;tab&gt;Life can be enjoyed on an intellectual level by achieving more and more knowledge about the world, the human behaviour, past cultures and works of art. In order to learn more about the world, one must study. Studying is made easier for younger people in our society in that universities and colleges and most likely to accept a high school graduate rather than a retired man. Therefore it becomes harder for older people to have the opportunity to enjoy the privileges of studying and of acquiring knowledge. This however does not mean it cannot be done. In fact there are specific study programs designed for older people, either online or in special universities.
&lt;tab&gt;By certain individuals, enjoying life means to be involved in the society and to have fun. Unfortunately our society tends to alienate the old in that they are considered “less active”. This is a mistake of the community. It is true that the older one gets the harder it is for him or her to be an active part in the society physically. However, the general term of “having fun” and being involved in society can be analysed at different levels and under many diverse points of views. Older people may have fun playing cards, while the younger ones finds fun in attending rave parties. Once again there are more opportunities for younger people to be involved in social events such as parties and sports related happenings. But it doesn’t mean there are NO opportunities for older people.
&lt;tab&gt;The older population is more limited also due to a physical factor that prevents their capability of performing and resistance. Therefore a younger person may enjoy life by practicing a certain sport, while an older person may have difficulties playing a sport and being of actual competition in it. But older people can still get great joy from watching sports.
&lt;tab&gt;Younger people have more access, freedom and possibilities to attend social events. Furthermore they tend to have less responsabilites such as a family. A younger person may have less responsabilites in that perhaps he or she is not yet married. This becomes an advantage in “having fun”, being that more time can be dedicated to theirselves rather than to their families. But for older people their fun is exactly the satifying they get from raising families so it’s just a different fun again.
&lt;tab&gt;In conclusion, I believe that younger people are given more chances by society and their physical status to “enjoy life”. They have more possibilities of attending mundane events, of studying and of playing sports. Furthermore younger people tend to have more time to dedicate to theirselves and to their enjoyment of life, and less responsabilites. However an older person may also enjoy life, in a different way as I have explained.

This essay meets all the requirements for a score of 5 by using well-developed examples that are relevant to the topic and by using highly varied vocabulary. The introductory paragraph clearly states the writer’s position that although younger people may have more opportunities to enjoy life, older people can enjoy it as well, but just differently. This is followed by the first point that society makes it easier for younger people to study and gain knowledge but that programs for older people also exist. The point is well developed and supports the writer’s objective. In the third and fourth paragraphs, the writer discusses how society may alienate older people because of their level of physical ability but then explains that older people may enjoy less physical activities that younger people may not enjoy, such as playing card games. This writer’s final point in paragraph 5, that younger people have fewer responsibilities, is also clear. All the points in the essay are developed in great detail, and the writer draws logical conclusions from each example. The advanced vocabulary used also adds to the essay’s high score. The essay does present some errors in usage (“I agree to the statement,” “By certain individuals”), but these errors do not interfere with the meaning and effectiveness of the writing.

Yes, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
Life is full of joy and happiness when one is young and full of energy, when one does not have any care for anyone and does not have much knowledge or experience of bitterness and sorrow of life.
&lt;tab&gt;Young people can enjoy life because they are usually free of many diseases the older people suffer from. They can easily run, jump and do many things which is not possible for many olders. Thus physical fitness allow them to enjoy the life.
&lt;tab&gt;They can enjoy life because they do not need to care for earning, for rent and pay other utilities bills. Finacial difficulties does not impress their young heart as much as doest to the adults. They usually deopend on their gardians for money. Therefore, they do not need to face the stresses concerning earning and maintaining daily livelihood.
 &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Unlike older people they are never alone. At home they are accompanied by either parents or other family members. At the streets they have their friends. If they do not have friends in a new community, they can make them very easily which could not be said about adults. In order to communicate with the other children they do not feel any barrier or complexity.
&lt;tab&gt;Being young they do not face many problems of life which adults do. They do not have enough knowledge about life which can make them unhappy. They seldom think about aging and death. They think that they would never grow old and die.
&lt;tab&gt;Therefore, there are many things in youth like young age, company, lack of care for money and lack of knowledg about the dark sides of life make them to feel happy and enjoy their life more than older people.

This essay contains four points that address the topic and support the writer’s opinion that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. The points are generally well developed, distinct from each other, and introduced with clear topic sentences in each body paragraph. The writer uses a nice range of vocabulary and strives to make the essay flow by using appropriate transitions and sentence structures (“Therefore, they do not need to face the stresses . . .”). Along with slightly less than full elaboration of points, errors in word choice (“. . . They do not need to care for earning”) and grammar (“things which is not possible for many olders,” “Finacial difficulties does not . . .,” “there are many things . . . Make them to feel happy”) do not interfere with meaning but are frequent enough to earn this essay a score of 4.

Although young people are more outgoing than older people, I do not agree with this statement. Older people are mostly retired and have much more time and money to go on trips and travel to other countrys. Younger people on the other hand have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot. But they are more interested in discovering new countrys and make new experiences. In comparison, older people already have a lot of experience and they often, just want to visite places where they have been before rather than go on exiting trips.
&lt;tab&gt;However, older peole often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as flexible as young people are. Young people can do whatever they want, whithout thinking about their health. Older people therefore are more interested in their own family, which is often the most important topic in their lifes. And to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into discos and stay up all night, what a lot of younger people do.
&lt;tab&gt;To sum up the main points, I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do, because there are so many things that older people can do which younger can not do. To my opinion older people enjoy their lifes different than younger people do, but there is no better way.

This  essay presents a fairly well-developed argument against the idea that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. The writer discusses 2 main points—that older people benefit more from the ability to travel and enjoy family time than younger people do—with a good amount of detail. While the overall meaning of the essay is clear, some of the ideas and connections are disjointed. In the second paragraph, for example, it is not clear how “therefore” connects the idea that older people may be more interested in family because younger people can do whatever they want without concern for their health. This minor structural flaw obscures the writer’s intentions. A few errors in usage (“make new experiences,” “what a lot of younger people do”) that do not interfere with meaning also contribute to earning this essay a score of 4.

Nowadays, young people have a lot of opportunities to enjoy life, more than older people have known when they were young. Thought, values especially in the way to bring up children have changed. I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for that reason and for several others. Young people are usually in good health, so they have more envy to live their life, more than older people who may have health problems or do not want to have too much activities. It is obvious that young people have time to enjoy their life, they are still on studies so they can have several activities, they have the possibility to do a lot of new experiences. Older people usually have a job and a family to look after, thet cannot do what they want, they have to give stability to them and their family. Nomad people are often single, it is difficult to enjoy your life free when you have assignements.
&lt;tab&gt;Moreover, when you are young you are very curious, interested by all you may learn. It is the exemple of the young child who wants to discover his environment. Generally, older people have already done a lot of things in their life such as sports, travels…
&lt;tab&gt;Young people want to learn others things, they like to meet with friends to go to cinema or to museum. The best way to discover other cultures is obviously to travel to foreign countries and meet locals to understand their culturs without judgments. I think the best way to discover other countries is to travel to them or to study during a year in them. Study abroad is a very exciting experience during which you can learn a lot, especially on yourself. I think it makes you grow up. You have to be adaptive, to ask you questions . . .
&lt;tab&gt;Finally, young people are incitated to move, to enjoy their lives through media, who help them to wide their mind to discovers and to other cultures. It is fundamental to young to discover all the world and open them to others, it should be a way to give them the possibility to continue to enjoy their life when they will be older.

This essay earns a score of 3 because it lacks development of its key points. The writer lists a number of reasons to support the idea that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. Some of these reasons are fairly clear, but they are not substantiated by concrete examples that can be readily understood as supporting the overall idea the writer presents in the first two sentences. It is not clear how the example of nomadic people relates to the idea that older people have more responsibilities. The most developed paragraph, about meeting friends and traveling abroad, has a number of ideas relevant to the question asked, but it is fairly difficult to understand how the ideas within the paragraph are connected. It is also difficult to see how all of the information is related to the topic or the writer’s opinion overall. For example, the writer does not explain how the statements that older people may have missed opportunities when they were young ties into the writer’s point. While much of the essay’s meaning is clear, this response is marked by some errors in grammar and word choice (“incitated to move,” “wide their mind”), and some of these are very difficult to understand (“more envy to live”). These types of errors limit the essay to a score of 3.

Life is a long travel that everybody can enjoyed. As young people discover new things everydays, older can use their own experiences to get more entertainment. The way, people, young or old, live their life is something that can not be discussed untill they do not hurt anybody.
&lt;tab&gt;In one hand, when you are a young people, you can learn, and find new things everydays. You meet lot of people in your primary school, your High School and your College. The young part of the life is done to enjoy every moments that will be cut of the future adult life. Futhermore, the fact that you are a young people allow you to communicate easily and to gain experiences fastly from your errors. Although, you also need advices from older people who have certainly lived what you have to ask.
&lt;tab&gt;In the other hand, older peolple have all the information that make life pleasant to live. Therefor peolple can think that, they will not enjoy life.In fact, if you already have all the advice you need to live, you can do something more exciting. Something like travel all around the world or take a new job because you have learned everything you thought you have to know. Moreover you also can interest to things that you have left behing. I mean when you were a student. It is not possible to take every courses you want to. But when you have done lot of things you can come back to the field that passionated you.
&lt;tab&gt;In short, I would say that if you do not enjoy your life when you are young you can not enjoy life when you are older. Therby, it is really important to take every moments as a single one and to enjoy it as if it was the only one you have.

This essay cannot earn a score higher than a 3 for a number of reasons. It displays numerous errors in word choice and expression (“something that can not be discussed until they do not hurt anybody,” “you also can interest to things”) and grammar (“discover new things everydays,” “the field that passionated you”) that are either distracting to the reader or occasionally obscure meaning. The writer promises in the introductory paragraph to elaborate on two main points— that younger people can discover new things and that older people can use their experience to enjoy life. However, these ideas are at best somewhat developed in paragraphs 2 and 3, though at times, the connections within each of these two paragraphs is a little unclear. Especially in the third paragraph, it is difficult to know exactly what the point is that the writer is trying to make until the end of the paragraph. Finally, the statement “if you do not enjoy life when you are young you can not enjoy life when you are older” is used as a conclusion, but this is a new idea that is not expressed or developed earlier in the body of the essay.

&lt;tab&gt;Older people are most quiet; like to stay at home with the family to watch tv or to read a book.

Lack of development, primarily, earns this essay a score of 2. The writer’s main point seems to be that it is not really the case that younger people enjoy life more; rather, the way younger and older people approach life is different in terms of their “passions” and “types of hobbies and lifestyles.” This would be a fine approach as a response to the question, but the writer simply does not give enough examples or any explanation in support. A score of 2 is given to responses that have limited development and insufficient exemplification and details to support generalizations.

Firstly, as mentionned above , young people make more activities than older. The maim reaom is a physical reason. They have not the same body than older people
For example a lot of young people make physical activities. They make sport each week. They play sport in club , have a lot of friends in the club. They like going in night clubs with their friends. We can say that they enjoy life.
&lt;tab&gt;Secondly, an other reason is that young people have not a private life ; a work, a household…. They have more time.
&lt;tab&gt;They don’t know that ‘time is money’ They don’t have jobs. They have not a woman, they must not going to supermarket after the work etc. they are always happy.
&lt;tab&gt;To sum up, young people enjoy life more than older for a certain point of view.
&lt;tab&gt;In my opinion , it’s very difficult to say that because we can says that a man who works each day , who is married and who have childrens can enjoy life more than younger people do. So, it’s a query of mind. They enjoy life in a different way.

Rembrandt is the most famous of the seventeenth-century Dutch painters. However, there are doubts whether some paintings attributed to Rembrandt were actually painted by him. One such painting is known as &lt;i&gt;Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet&lt;/i&gt; . The painting was attributed to Rembrandt because of its style, and indeed the representation of the woman’s face is very much like that of portraits known to be by Rembrandt. But there are problems with the painting that suggest it could not be a work by Rembrandt.

First, there is something inconsistent about the way the woman in the portrait is dressed. She is wearing a white linen cap of a kind that only servants would wear—yet the coat she is wearing has a luxurious fur collar that no servant could afford. Rembrandt, who was known for his attention to the details of his subjects’ clothing, would not have been guilty of such an inconsistency.

Second, Rembrandt was a master of painting light and shadow, but in this painting these elements do not fit together. The face appears to be illuminated by light reflected onto it from below. But below the face is the dark fur collar, which would absorb light rather than reflect it. So the face should appear partially in shadow—which is not how it appears. Rembrandt would never have made such an error.

Finally, examination of the back of the painting reveals that it was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood glued together. Although Rembrandt often painted on wood panels, no painting known to be by Rembrandt uses a panel glued together in this way from several pieces of wood.

For these reasons the painting was removed from the official catalog of Rembrandt’s paintings in the 1930s.

Both texts deal with the question wheather or not the painting “Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet” was painted by the most famous Dutch painter Rembrandt. The text clearly states, that many facts prove that it wasn’t painted by Rembrandt himself, but just attributed to him because of its style. In the lecture however the professor gives proof why it is in fact a work of the famous Dutch painter.
&lt;tab&gt;The first contradicting fact are the clothes of the woman in the portrait. She is wearing a white linen cap which gives her the appearance of a simple servant, whereas the luxurious fur collar she also wears doesn’t fit. In the lecture is said, that after a thorough research people found out that the fur collar was added to the painting about 100 years later in order to increase the value of the workpiece, because now it illustrated an aristocratic lady instead of a servant.
&lt;tab&gt;Another problem with the painting was the display of light and shadow. Rembandt was known as a master of painting light and shadow, yet contradictionally the elements in the work don’t fit together. But this problem could also be explained by now. By removing the additional fur collar one could see that the lady is wearing a simple light colored cloth, which reflects light into her face.
&lt;tab&gt;The third aspect which let people wonder about the origins of the painting was the fact, that the panel was made of several pieces of wood glued together instead of just one panel which was usual for works of Rembrandt. But the additional panels were also added later to enlarge the paiting. By doing this the painting seemed to be more valuable.
&lt;tab&gt;Another interesting fact is, that the main panel is made from the same tree like another painting of Rembrandt, ‘Selfportrait with a hat’.
&lt;tab&gt;In the end it is clear that this painting is indeed a work of the Dutch painter and it should be reintegrated in the catalog of Rembrandt’s paintings.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
This essay earns a score of 5 because it successfully explains the opposing relationship between the reading and the lecture and goes on to identify all the important points and details. The response is appropriately organized, with the topic stated in the first and final paragraphs and each main point discussed in separate body paragraphs. Each main point is discussed clearly and with a good amount of detail. The writer, for example, correctly represents in the second paragraph the idea that the fur collar was added to the painting at a later date to make it appear more valuable. In the third paragraph, the light-and-shadow inconsistency is not described in concrete terms, but the writer does indicate it in general terms and explains its cause. Connectors and connecting phrases (“Another problem,” “By removing the additional fur collar,” “In the end”) help make the writing cohesive and easy to read. The language is generally accurate, and minor errors (“In the lecture is said,” “after a thorough research,” “contradictionally”) do not interfere with meaning.

&lt;tab&gt;The woman portraited wears a linen cap and is therefore recognizable as a servant. Although, she also wears a valuable collar which a servent could never had afforded at the time the painting was done. Rembrandt, who cared a lot about the clothing of the people he painted, would not have made such a mistake.
&lt;tab&gt;The professor gives an explanation for this inconsistency using facts which were propably not known to the author. The collar was added about 100 years after the painting was originally done, perhaps to make it more valuable portraiing a aristocratic person instead of a simple servant.
&lt;tab&gt;A second error in the painting which is mentioned in the text can also be explained by the later added collar. In the original painting the white linnen reflected the light, enlightening the face of the model from below. When adding the collar the artist did not fit this enlightment to the new clothing.
&lt;tab&gt;The text also mentions that the painting is done on glued together wood panels, which is untypical for Rembrandt. The professor explains that the painting was enlarged by gluing woods to the sides, long after Rembrandt painted it.

This essay effectively addresses the topic by summarizing most of the important information in the reading and lecture. The first point, discussed in paragraph 2— concerning the servant woman’s clothing—is the best-developed idea. The fourth paragraph correctly identifies the addition of the fur collar as a source of another problem, but it does not clearly explain what the problem is and how it arose. Although the writer correctly indicates that the original white collar in the painting reflects light onto the woman’s face, it is not clear what the “second error in the painting which is mentioned in the text” is. A clearer response would have explained that the apparent errors of light and shadow in the painting could be explained by the fur collar that was added to the painting later. The third point, in the fifth paragraph—concerning the wood panel—is discussed in a fair amount of detail, although the writer leaves out the reason for adding the side panels. Language errors in the response are minor, but they sometimes interfere with meaning. In the second paragraph, for example, “Although” is not a well-chosen connector, and the phrase “Rembrandt, who cared a lot about the clothing” is a bit imprecise. In the fourth paragraph, the clause “the artist did not fit this enlightment to the new clothing” also creates a minor lapse in clarity. Overall, the response earns a score of 4 due to minor omissions and minor lapses of clarity.

There are doubts whether Rembramdt painted Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet. The reading says that the painting wasn’t paint by Rembrandt because of the leck of consistency observed. On the other hand the lecture says that Rembrandt is the real painter. The opinion expressed in the lecture is based on a third examination of the painting when the experts decided that Rembrandt is the real painter because of the examination of the fur colar, the light and shadow that were realistic and finally the elements of the wood panel.
&lt;tab&gt;Examining the fur colar from the painting, the experts noticed that the actual colar was painted over the top of the original painting over 100 years later. The reason of doing this was to increase the value of the painting.
&lt;tab&gt;Further on the light and color were very realistic, says the lecture. This opinion is formulated in opossition to the one from the reading that says that in this painting this elements do not fit together.
&lt;tab&gt;Finally the last reason why the lecture affirms that the painting belongs to Rebmrandt is based on the examination of the wood panel. Even though the wood panel was enlarged it was used the same tree that Rembrandt used in Self Portrait with a Hat.
&lt;tab&gt;In conclusion it seems that the argument given by the lecture overpower the reading part.

Although this response clearly describes the relationship between the reading and the lecture in the first paragraph, it earns a score of 3 because it lacks some important details related to the three main points that follow. In the second paragraph, the writer does explain that the fur collar was added to the painting 100 years after it was created to increase its value, but the writer does not explain the initial problem mentioned in the reading (that the fur collar was not consistent with a servant woman’s apparel). This makes it difficult for a reader who is not familiar with the passage and the lecture to see how the information about the collar is relevant to the topic. The third paragraph, in contrast, does indicate that the information from the reading and the information from the lecture regarding light and shadow differ, but this section lacks most of the important details. The third point, in paragraph 4, is not expressed precisely. The writer indicates that the fact that the wood came from the same tree as the wood for another Rembrandt painting is proof of its authenticity, yet it is not clear whether the writer is referring to the original panel or to the added panels. The writer also does not explain why the original panel was enlarged. Overall, the essay responds to the task and touches on all three main ideas, but these ideas are either vaguely or imprecisely conveyed. The language is generally clear, with only a few minor errors (“the painting wasn’t paint by Rembrandt,” “this elements do not fit together”) that do not interfere with meaning.

This response earns a score of 2 because it offers limited details related to the main points and contains multiple language errors that either are distracting or interfere with meaning (“a hundred years later its realzation,” “a part of waer was originally white,” “composed by many pieces and glow”). Structurally, the essay is difficult to follow because the issues raised in the reading are not effectively connected to the related information from the lecture. The first point, that the painting was altered by another painter, lacks important information about the fur collar and the discrepancy between the collar and the servant woman’s customary clothing. In the second paragraph, the writer explains why light did not reflect correctly in the painting, but since the explanation is not connected to the addition of the fur collar, it remains somewhat unclear. The final point is not expressed clearly and lacks many important details.

&lt;tab&gt;The second thing is that Rembrant was very able to paint light and shadow, but in this painting the face appears to be illuminated by lights and the the the dark fur collar, which would absorb light, so the faca should appear partially in shadow.

<Rationale>&lt;b&gt;Topic Notes&lt;/b&gt;
This topic asks you to write about whether keeping old friends is more important than making new friends. Successful responses can agree with the statement, disagree with the statement, or discuss why old and new friends are equally important. No matter which position you take, it is important to support your opinion with details and examples.

If you agree with the statement, you should present and develop reasons that old friends are better than new friends. Some reasons for preferring old friends may include their ability to understand you, their willingness to help you in difficult situations, and interests and experiences they share with you. As part of supporting this approach, you could also mention that new friends do not have these attributes.

If you disagree with the statement, you should present and develop reasons that new friends are better than old friends. Some reasons for preferring new friends may include the opportunity to learn about different opinions and cultures, the chance to have new experiences, and the benefit of being around friends who understand changes in your life.

If you believe that old and new friends are equally important, you should present a balanced argument that explains the benefits of both types of friends. This can include points mentioned above, but many reasons not mentioned here can also be used in an effective essay.

In a lifetime, we are bound to meet many people, we get on well with some of them and they become our friends. As we grow up we meet new people and make new friends but it does not imply that they will replace our old ones. That is why I disagree with people who think that keeping old friends is more important than making new friends.
&lt;tab&gt;I think that there is no matter of more importance. Since old friends and new friends do not bring us the same things, we can not compare them. Indeed old friends are the ones we can count on; we trust them, they know us well, we have complicity and real friendship is just wondrful. When I feel sad or when I need to talk to someone about a serious problem, I go to see my old friends because they are reliable and I know that they will understand me more than anyone else. My old friends are very important to me and I agree with the fact that it is important to keep them and make efforts to keep contact.
&lt;tab&gt;However, I must admit that we are bound to lose some of our old friends sometimes. For example, I had a very good friend a few years ago but we do not see each other anymore since I moved in an other town. I guess that we also grew up and took a different way and there is no use to keep old friends when you realize that you have nothing left in common.
&lt;tab&gt;Therefore, it is also very important to make new friends. That is a way to learn, to change and they bring us different things. Making new friends makes us more open-minded, and in this way we can discover new personalities. For my part I enjoy making new friends, at school, at work, on holidays. I am conscious not to have close relationships with them at first but I need to be with other people and have fun. Sometimes they just remain acquaintances but they can also become good friends who could become old friends one day. For instance, I met a german girl on holiday two years ago and we got on very well, so we kept in touch and I went to visit her in Germany twice. She belongs to this kind of people who you know that they will be important in your life, and who you know you can have a long and strong friendship with.
&lt;tab&gt;As a conclusion I would say that everybody need to have a at least few real and strong friendship.

This level 5 essay effectively responds to the question by arguing the importance of having both old and new friends. The essay is organized logically, beginning with an introductory paragraph that states a clear thesis and continuing with three body paragraphs that develop distinct reasons that support the thesis. Each of the writer’s points is well developed with appropriate details and examples. The first point, that old friends are reliable and understanding, is supported by the idea that old friends can help with serious problems. This is followed in the third paragraph by the idea that it is sometimes possible to lose old friendships. Here, the writer gives the example of losing a friend because of a move and no longer having anything in common. This third paragraph provides a nice connection between the ideas of wanting to keep old friends in the second paragraph and needing to make new friends in the fourth paragraph. This cohesion is also accomplished by using effective transitions (“However, I must admit,” “Therefore, it is also very important to make new friends.”). The final point, that it is important to make new friends, is also well supported by details about learning new things. The essay is rounded out by a personal example that shows that new friends can become old friends. Overall, this essay has nice progression and displays consistently strong language. The few language errors (“moved in an other town,” “She belongs to this kind of people who you know”) that do exist do not interfere with meaning and are not prevalent enough to lower the essay’s score.

In the following essay I would like to express my opinion in regard to the thesis “It is more important to keep your old friends than it is to make new friends”.
&lt;tab&gt;On the one hand, you could always say that making new friends is a lot more entertaining than keeping in touch with the old ones. There are new topics to talk about, new activities to do together, new personality traits to discover… Additionally, you also get to meet the persons who are close to your new friends. And maybe you will even receive a whole group of new friends by making one new friend.
&lt;tab&gt;However, you could also say that it makes much more sense to keep in touch with your old friends since they are your true friends. Firstly, you already know how they react to certain situations and therefore you know how to treat them to get along well. Secondly, I am of the conviction that it is certain that in a bit more peculiar and maybe a bit unpleasant situations it is a lot more likely that your old friends will help you out than that someone you have met barely a week ago would do the same.
&lt;tab&gt;I have to admit that I personally came to the conclusion that I need my old friends as well as my new friends. For me they are both equally important. I adore keeping in touch with my old friends and knowing how they will react in most situations. Of course, over the years some sort of bond and a special kind of trust has developed with my long-time friends.
&lt;tab&gt;However, I immensely enjoy making new friends as well. I enjoy trying out new activities and making new friends there. Furthermore, I like making friends from all kinds of different cultures and countries. And I am certain that this kind of attitude makes life much more interesting. Plus, I believe that new friends will also broaden your horizon because their beliefs may differ from your own.
&lt;tab&gt;Personally, I am convinced that nobody has to decide between old friends and new friends since the possibily of keeping the old friends and making new ones always exists. Therefore as a final statement I would like to say “Cherish you old friends and enjoy making new ones as well”.

This essay effectively addresses the topic with clear language and appropriate details, earning it a score of 5. The writer gradually develops the idea that it is not necessary to choose between having old or new friends. Initially, the writer examines both sides of the issue: the benefits of making new friends in paragraph 2 and of keeping old friends in paragraph 3. These are treated with equal value and logically lead to the author’s opinion in paragraph 4 that both old and new friends are equally important. This is well supported by details such as the importance of trust in old friendships and the excitement of new experiences in new friendships. This leads to an effective concluding paragraph that states the thesis and makes the writer’s overall intent clear. The language throughout the essay is strong, with only minor weaknesses or possibly just slipups in typing (“than that someone you have met barely a week ago would do the same”) that do not detract from the quality of the writing. The use of transitions throughout the response generally helps the essay to progress and adds to the effectiveness of the writing.

My personal experience showed me that both keeping old friends and making new ones is important: it depends on the different needs of life.
&lt;tab&gt;When I left my country to move in France for studing I tried to keep in contact with all my Italian friends in order to feel less far from home and to keep in mind where I am from, expecially in some moments of lonelyness. After several mounths nearly all the persons I considered as ‘’friends’’ keeped less and less in contact with me, making me understand that we were experiencing different stages of our life and therefore it was difficult to keep the same relationship we had before because everyone was growing in a different way.
&lt;tab&gt;In the meanwhile I found new friends at university and I started to discover new kinds of relationships, sometimes very different from the ones I was habitued to. For exemple at the beginning I found very strange the fact that French young people use to see each others in the ‘’café`’’ and spend their time and their money there smooking, chatting and drinking. With my Italian friends we use to see each other outside, near the seaside for a volleyball match indeed or at someones`s home in the evening to make a pizza party togheter, without spending too much money.
&lt;tab&gt;These different habits make me think about how different could be one culture compare to another and how difficult would have been for me to keep the same relationship with both types of friends.
&lt;tab&gt;On one side I prefered the way I behaved with my old friends and I missed them, but on the other side, I realized the necessity of seeking for new friends, so I tried to agree to their habits and I experienced something else.
&lt;tab&gt;Today I can say that this kind of experience has been very usefull for me. Last summer, coming back home for holidays I organized a party to my house nearbye the mountains and I invited both French new friends and my Italians old ones. The result was that with the new ones I experienced something they have never done before, and this strenthned our friendship, wherease with the old ones I felt home like everytime, as I had never left, as our friendship had never been changed.
&lt;tab&gt;To conclude, I think both old and new friends are very importants, because trough them we can learn about our self and our changes in anytime; sometimes they are the mirror of what we were and what we become.

The writer of this level 4 essay addresses the topic well and fully develops his or her point of view through sharing personal experiences. The essay begins with a clear statement of the thesis, that “keeping old friends and making new ones is important,” depending on a person’s needs. The writer then uses the experience of moving to another country to appropriately explain how old friends helped him or her to feel less lonely and to retain a sense of his or her native culture, and how new friends helped him or her adjust to a new culture. This example effectively leads to the conclusion that both old and new friends are helpful through life’s changes. While the points in this response are well developed and organized, the essay cannot earn a score of 5 because of multiple language errors that occur throughout. Errors in both grammar (“keeped less and less in contact,” “how different could be one culture”) and word choice (“I was habitued”) often do not obscure meaning but are frequent enough to lower the essay’s score to 4.

In today’s society, life is becoming more impersonal and invidualist. That’s why having friends, it’s for me very important. But, I have a mix view when it comes to friends because it’s not so easy. I don’t think that one of the statement is more important than another one. I need both.
&lt;tab&gt;First, keeping old friends is for me the most important. If you have a friend for a long time, that’s mean that he knows you very well and he can help you when you need it. For instance, if you have a problem or a decision to make, an old friend will be able to help you and give you good advices. On the contrary a new friend may not do it very well.
&lt;tab&gt;Second, with old friends you can share everything. You will not feel any shame because you know that he has already saw you in ridiculous situations for example.
&lt;tab&gt;Lastly, when you have a huge problem, it is common to say that best friends are always with you. They never let you alone and they don’t care in what people think.
&lt;tab&gt;Although I really believe that it is very important to keep your old friends, I also think that it’s necessary to make new friends. In your daily life, you’re always evolving and changing; that’s why sometimes you can’t share everything with old friends because they just can’t understand exactly your new way of thinking. With a new friend, it could be easiest to evolve ant see the things differently.
&lt;tab&gt;It’s also important to have a large relationship with different people. Like that you will be open-minded. In this way, new friends can make you discover new things such as a new place to visit or a new sport activity. For example, I lived in Barcelone for two years and I made new friends, actually, spanih friends. It was very interesting for me to meet new people. I was alone, without my old friends, and my new friends made me feel good. I could enjoy visiting the country and going out. I also changed my mind being with them. They helped me to think in another way, because they made me share a new culture, their culture.
&lt;tab&gt;For all these reasons, I think that both are important. You need to keep your old friends, they will be there for everything but you also need new friends to evolve.

While this essay responds to the question appropriately, it earns a score of 4 because of minor language errors and underdevelopment of the main points presented. Although the language used is generally clear and easy to understand, minor errors (“that’s mean that,” “he has already saw you”) occur more frequently than they would in a level 5 essay. The introduction to the essay is weak. The thesis statement (“I don’t think that one of the statement is more important than another one. I need both.”) does not sufficiently introduce the topic, and a reader not already familiar with the topic may struggle to identify the purpose of the essay. Despite this, the essay is generally well organized. The writer makes three points to support the need for old friends and two points to support the need for new friends. Each point is clearly stated in a distinct paragraph. Some of these points (that old friends can help in times of need in the second paragraph and that new friends can help people to be open-minded in the sixth paragraph) are very well developed with details and personal examples. Other points (that you can share everything with old friends in the third paragraph and that old friends never leave you alone in the fourth paragraph) are merely stated without any supporting details. These issues lower an otherwise clear response to a score of 4.

One of the most important thing in life is to spend time with the person you consider to be your best friend, in my opinion.
&lt;tab&gt;Firstable, nobody cannot know you better than an old friend does.
&lt;tab&gt;Your old friend can really guess you before you begin to speak. You do not have to explain all of your feelings he knows you too much for that. This feeling of understanding is incredibly good. It is like you are not alone anymore.
&lt;tab&gt;Secondly, keeping your old friends is the best way to have a link between your past and your life. It is a excellent pattern to know if you have changed well or not. It helps to keep your personnality and your personnal interests throught your life.
&lt;tab&gt;In addition, Old friends continue to be friends because they helps each other with the life difficulties.
&lt;tab&gt;The kind of helps creates a really deep love and friendship and it is why we say friends forever. It is too deep to give up. Consequently, friends become part of the family after many years. For example, I have had the same best friend since 1990. I know her and she knows me perfectly. I am closer to her than my own sister. We have share everything and we could be separate more than one month. I like her advices and our complementarity.

While this essay generally addresses the topic clearly, it earns a score of 3 because it features flaws in the development of some of its ideas and in overall structure. The writer lists three points to support the idea that old friends are important. The first two points, that old friends understand each other’s feelings and that they provide a link to a person’s past, are clearly expressed but only somewhat developed with vague explanations. The third point, that old friends can help each other through difficult times, is entirely unsupported. In addition, some elements in the response interrupt the progression of the essay. It is not clear how the sixth paragraph, which discusses the writer’s best friend, supports any of the three points mentioned earlier in the essay. The first sentence in the seventh paragraph (“To clarify my opinion, I would say that for me it is also good to make new friends and to change your routine.”) is also out of place and suggests that a new topic will be discussed, although the focus of the essay remains on the importance of old friends. These flaws, along with minor language errors (“they helps each other with the life difficulties,” “I really need more my old friends that the new I have met.”), earn this essay a score of 3.

Both old friends and new friends are important for a person’s social life. Old friends give you security but new friends give you the bigger advantage: to make new experiences.
&lt;tab&gt;For my own, I keep my new friends as more important as my old friends. That has many reasons. A person changes in the course of time in his behaviour and in his way of thinking. So, it is normal if you also change the persons which are arround of you and can talk to about your problems. It is true that an old friend know you much better and so he can maybe handle better with you when you need help but it is also true that an old friend know you too good so his advices are maybe not useful anymore for you. An old friend has often the same point of view as you, a normal conseguence of a long friendship. So a new friend might it make possible to have access to new points of view and can help you more. He does not have yet a fixed opinion about you not knowing so much about your family backround, for example. An old friend which knows you since your childhood and knows your whole family is not yet in a neutral position. That makes it difficult to give you neutral advices, especially if the problems you have concerns your familiy. But not only when you have problems, a friend is useful but also in other situation in which I prefer again new friends. I know new people and with them new life styles. So I can learn a lot for my own life. As a conclusion, new friends show you new prospectives of life and help you to know the world better.

This essay earns a score of 3 primarily because of lack of organization and development of its main ideas. The writer takes the position that new friends are more important than old friends. The reasons supporting this idea, however, are not as easy to distinguish as they might have been if developed in separate paragraphs. Instead, multiple ideas are briefly mentioned in the second paragraph (that new friends accommodate changes in life, that they can offer neutral advice, and that they help build new ideas), making it a little difficult for a reader to follow the writer’s logic. The writer does, however, offer some good support for the idea that new friends can offer neutral advice because they are not familiar with the friend’s past and family. The response might also have been scored higher had it further developed the topic introduced at the end about new friends showing new perspectives and helping you know the world better. If these ideas had been developed with a few details or examples, this response would have been more highly rated. Most of the language used is also clear, although many minor language errors (“For my own,” “neutral advices”) that generally do not affect meaning do exist.

This is a very interesting argument, because for me the friends are all. The old friends or the new friends are much important, but sincerally, I think that the old friends are more important than new friends. The old friend known you very well, they helped you in many occasions and they shared with you many experience.
&lt;tab&gt;This is true only if a friend is a real friend, like a brother. In my opinion to make new friends is important too; you can to know new persons, to meet new persons.
&lt;tab&gt;The importance of to keep my old friends is that they are and they will be a fixed point in my life and without them I feel lost.

Although this response is clearly geared toward the topic, underdevelopment of the writer’s main ideas and a limited command of the language earn this essay a score of 2. The writer seems to believe that it is good to have both old friends and new friends. This opinion, however, is not entirely obvious because the essay lacks a clear thesis, and the ideas presented throughout the essay seem to waver between both sides of the argument. The ideas that are included in the response are typically stated in a single sentence, without supporting details or examples. Many distracting language errors (“The old friends or the new friends are much important, but sincerally,” “you can to know new persons,” “I go to him immediatily…and I hope that He goes too”) that occasionally interfere with meaning can also be seen throughout the response.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
This level 2 essay addresses the topic and develops two main ideas that support the opinion that both old and new friends are important. These two ideas are supported with a limited amount of detail. In the second paragraph, the point that old friends are important is supported by the example that old friends know how to make a person happy when something bad happens, such as receiving a low grade in school. In the third paragraph, the point that new friends are important is supported by the idea that new friends can offer new experiences, such as learning from different personalities or being exposed to different cultures. Overall, however, it is very difficult to extract these ideas from the language that this writer uses. The weak use of language throughout the essay and the limited development of ideas are both reasons this essay earns no higher than a score of 2.

&lt;b&gt;Rater Comments&lt;/b&gt;
This essay earns a score of 1 because it lacks any development of its main points and contains many language errors that obscure meaning. The writer seems to present only one idea to support the opinion that old friends are important. Because of language errors that interfere with the writer’s purpose, the limited idea that is offered is almost incomprehensible.

Although substantially longer than the average essay with a score of 1, this response earns the low score because it contains consistent language errors that make the overall essay difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend.</Rationale>

&lt;b&gt;Bus Service Elimination Planned&lt;/b&gt;
The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses are expensive to operate. Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots.</Question>

&lt;b&gt;Social Interaction&lt;/b&gt;
People deal with each other every day. This interaction is at the heart of social life. The study of social interaction is concerned with the influence people have over one another’s behavior. People take each other into account in their daily behavior and in fact, the very presence of others can affect behavior. For example, one principle of social interaction, audience effects, suggests that individuals’ work is affected by their knowledge that they are visible to others, that the presence of others tends to alter the way people behave or perform an activity.</Question>

&lt;b&gt;University May Build New Student Apartments Off Campus&lt;/b&gt;
The Department of Student Housing is considering whether to build new student housing off campus in a residential area of town. Two of the major factors influencing the decision will be parking and space. Those who support building off campus argue that building new housing on campus would further increase the number of cars on and around campus and consume space that could be better used for future projects that the entire university community could benefit from. Supporters also say that students might even have a richer college experience by being connected to the local community and patronizing stores and other businesses in town.</Question>

<Question>Now read the passage about a topic in psychology. You will have 45 seconds to read the passage. Begin reading now.

&lt;b&gt;Actor-observer&lt;/b&gt;
People account for their own behavior differently from how they account for the behavior of others. When observing the behavior of others, we tend to attribute their actions to their character or their personality rather than to external factors. In contrast, we tend to explain our own behavior in terms of situational factors beyond our own control rather than attributing it to our own character. One explanation for this difference is that people are aware of the situational forces affecting them but not of situational forces affecting other people. Thus when evaluating someone else’s behavior, we focus on the person rather than the situation.</Question>

<Question>The university&apos;s dining services department has announced a change. Read an announcement about this change. You will have 45 seconds to read the announcement. Begin reading now.

&lt;b&gt;Hot Breakfasts Eliminated&lt;/b&gt;
Beginning next month, Dining Services will no longer serve hot breakfast foods at university dining halls. Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change. Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.</Question>

<Question>Read the passage from a sociology textbook. You have 50 seconds to read the passage. Begin reading now.

&lt;b&gt;Cognitive Dissonance&lt;/b&gt;
Individuals sometimes experience a contradiction between their actions and their beliefs—between what they are doing and what they believe they should be doing. These contradictions can cause a kind of mental discomfort known as cognitive dissonance. People experiencing cognitive dissonance often do not want to change the way they are acting, so they resolve the contradictory situation in another way: they change their interpretation of the situation in a way that minimizes the contradiction between what they are doing and what they believe they should be doing.</Question>
